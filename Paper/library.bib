abstract = {In this paper we voice concerns about the uncritical manner in which the mean is often used as a summary statistic in psychological research. We identify a number of implicit assumptions underlying the use of the mean and argue that the fragility of these assumptions should be more carefully considered. We examine some of the ways in which the potential violation of these assumptions can lead us into significant theoretical and methodological error. Illustrations of alternative models of research already extant within Psychology are used to explore methods of research less mean-dependent and suggest that a critical assessment of the assumptions underlying its use in research play a more explicit role in the process of study design and review.},

abstract = {An important class of sequential-sampling models for response time (RT) assumes that evidence for competing response alternatives accrues in parallel and that a response is made when the evidence total for a particular response exceeds a criterion. One member of this class of models is the Poisson counter model, in which evidence accrues in unit increments and the waiting time between increments is exponentially distributed. This paper generalizes the counter model to allow the Poisson event rate to vary with time. General expressions are obtained for the RT distributions for the two- and the m-alternative cases. Closed-form expressions are obtained for response probabilities under a proportional-rates assumption and for mean RT under conditions in which the integrated event rate increases as an arbitrary power of time. An application in the area of early vision is described, in which the Poisson event rates are proportional to the outputs of sustained and transient channels.},

decision, and reading (with eye fixation times on a target word measured).
We examined the word frequency effect for a common set of words for
each task and each subject. Naming and reading (particularly gaze
duration) yielded similar frequency effects for the target words.
The frequency effect found in lexical decision was greater than that
found in naming and in eye fixation times. In all tasks, there was
a correlation between the frequency effect and average response time.
In general, the results suggest that both the naming and the lexical
decision tasks yield data about word recognition processes that are
consistent with effects found in eye fixations during silent reading.},

@article{Husain2009,
abstract = {This is the first attempt at characterizing reading difficulty in Hindi using naturally occurring sentences. We created the Potsdam-Allahabad Hindi Eyetracking Corpus by recording eye-movement data from 30 participants at the University of Allahabad, India. The target stimuli were 153 sentences selected from the beta version of the Hindi-Urdu treebank. We find that word-or low-level predictors (syllable length, unigram and bigram frequency) affect first-pass reading times, regression path dura-tion, total reading time, and outgoing saccade length. An increase in syllable length results in longer fixations, and an increase in word unigram and bigram frequency leads to shorter fixations. Longer syllable length and higher frequency lead to longer outgoing saccades. We also find that two predictors of sentence comprehension diffi-culty, integration and storage cost, have an effect on reading difficulty. Integration cost (Gibson, 2000) was approximated by calculating the distance (in words) between a dependent and head; and storage cost (Gibson, 2000), which measures difficulty of maintaining predictions, was estimated by counting the number of predicted heads at each point in the sentence. We find that integration cost mainly affects outgoing saccade length, and storage cost affects total reading times and outgoing saccade length. Thus, word-level predictors have an effect in both early and late measures of reading time, while predictors of sentence comprehension difficulty tend to affect later measures. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration using eye-tracking that both integration and storage cost influence reading difficulty.},

on "good-enough" interpretations for garden-path sentences (e.g.,
"While Anna dressed the baby played in the crib") as indicated by
their responding "Yes" to questions probing the initial, syntactically
unlicensed interpretation (e.g., "Did Anna dress the baby?"). The
manipulation of several factors expected to influence the probability
of generating or maintaining the unlicensed interpretation resulted
in 2 major age differences: Older adults were generally more likely
to endorse the incorrect interpretation for sentences containing
optionally transitive verbs (e.g., hunted, paid), and they showed
decreased availability of the correct interpretation of subordinate
clauses containing reflexive absolute transitive verbs (e.g., dress,
bathe). These age differences may in part be linked to older adults'
increased reliance on heuristic-like good-enough processing to compensate
for age-related deficits in working memory capacity. The results
support previous studies suggesting that syntactic reanalysis may
not be an all-or-nothing process and might not be completed unless
questions probing unresolved aspects of the sentence structure challenge
the resultant interpretation.},

abstract = {Three experiments examined contingent attentional capture, which is the finding that cuing effects are larger when cues are perceptually similar to a target than when they are dissimilar to the target. This study also analyzed response times (RTs) in terms of the underlying distributions for valid cues and invalid cues. Specifically, an ex-Gaussian analysis and a vincentile analysis examined the influence of top-down attentional control settings on the shift and skew of RT distributions and how the shift and the skew contributed to the cuing effects in the mean RTs. The results showed that cue/target similarity influenced the size of cuing effects. The RT distribution analyses showed that the cuing effects reflected only a shifting effect, not a skewing effect, in the RT distribution between valid cues and invalid cues. That is, top-down attentional control moderated the cuing effects in the mean RTs through distribution shifting, not distribution skewing. The results support the contingent orienting hypothesis (Folk, Remington, {\&} Johnston, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 18, 1030-1044, 1992) over the attentional disengagement account (Theeuwes, Atchley, {\&} Kramer, 2000) as an explanation for when top-down attentional settings influence the selection of salient stimuli.},

@article{TongEtAl2007,
abstract = {Echo State Networks (ESNs) have been shown to be effective for a number
of tasks, including motor control, dynamic time series prediction,
and memorizing musical sequences. However, their performance on natural
language tasks has been largely unexplored until now. Simple Recurrent
Networks (SRNs) have a long history in language modeling and show
a striking similarity in architecture to ESNs. A comparison of SRNs
and ESNs on a natural language task is therefore a natural choice
for experimentation. Elman applies SRNs to a standard task in statistical
NLP: predicting the next word in a corpus, given the previous words.
Using a simple context-free grammar and an SRN with backpropagation
through time (BPTT), Elman showed that the network was able to learn
internal representations that were sensitive to linguistic processes
that were useful for the prediction task. Here, using ESNs, we show
that training such internal representations is unnecessary to achieve
levels of performance comparable to SRNs. We also compare the processing
capabilities of ESNs to bigrams and trigrams. Due to some unexpected
regularities of Elman's grammar, these statistical techniques are
capable of maintaining dependencies over greater distances than might
be initially expected. However, we show that the memory of ESNs in
this word-prediction task, although noisy, extends significantly
beyond that of bigrams and trigrams, enabling ESNs to make good predictions
of verb agreement at distances over which these methods operate at
chance. Overall, our results indicate a surprising ability of ESNs
to learn a grammar, suggesting that they form useful internal representations
without learning them.},

abstract = {Much research suggests that words comprising more than one morpheme are represented in a "decomposed" manner in the visual word recognition system. In the research presented here, we investigate what information is used to segment a word into its morphemic constituents and, in particular, whether semantic information plays a role in that segmentation. Participants made visual lexical decisions to stem targets preceded by masked primes sharing (1) a semantically transparent morphological relationship with the target (e.g., cleaner-CLEAN), (2) an apparent morphological relationship but no semantic relationship with the target (e.g., corner-CORN), and (3) a nonmorphological form relationship with the target (e.g., brothel-BROTH). Results showed significant and equivalent masked priming effects in cases in which primes and targets appeared to be morphologically related, and priming in these conditions could be distinguished from nonmorphological form priming. We argue that these findings suggest a level of representation at which apparently complex words are decomposed on the basis of their morpho-orthographic properties. Implications of these findings for computational models of reading are discussed.},

abstract = {Mindless reading occurs when the eyes continue moving across the page even though the mind is thinking about something unrelated to the text. Despite how commonly it occurs, very little is known about mindless reading. The present experiment examined eye movements during mindless reading. Comparisons of fixation-duration measures collected during intervals of normal reading and intervals of mindless reading indicate that fixations during the latter were longer and less affected by lexical and linguistic variables than fixations during the former. Also, eye movements immediately preceding self-caught mind wandering were especially erratic. These results suggest that the cognitive processes that guide eye movements during normal reading are not engaged during mindless reading. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of eye movement control in reading, for the distinction between experiential awareness and meta-awareness, and for reading comprehension.},

Among frequentists in psychology a shift of emphasis from hypothesis testing to estimation has been dubbed " the New Statistics " (Cumming, 2014). A second conceptual distinction is between frequentist methods and Bayesian methods. Our main goal in this article is to explain how Bayesian methods achieve the goals of the New Statistics better than frequentist methods. The article reviews frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing and to estimation with confidence or credible intervals.

abstract = {Although response times (RTs) are the dependent measure of choice in the majority of studies of visual attention, changes in RTs can be hard to interpret. First, they are inherently ambiguous, since they may reflect a change in the central tendency or skew (or both) of a distribution. Second, RT measures may lack sensitivity, since meaningful changes in RT patterns may not be picked up if they reflect two or more processes having opposing influences on mean RTs. Here we describe RT distributions for repetition priming in visual search, fitting ex-Gaussian functions to RT distributions. We focus here on feature and conjunction search tasks, since priming effects in these tasks are often thought to reflect similar mechanisms. As expected, both tasks resulted in strong priming effects when target and distractor identities repeated, but a large difference between feature and conjunction search was also seen, in that the $\sigma$ parameter (reflecting the standard deviation of the Gaussian component) was far more affected by search repetition in conjunction than in feature search. Although caution should clearly be used when particular parameter estimates are matched to specific functions or processes, our results suggest that analyses of RT distributions can inform theoretical accounts of priming in visual search tasks, in this case showing quite different repetition effects for the two differing search types, suggesting that priming in the two paradigms partly reflects different mechanisms.},

The manipulation of several factors expected to influence the probability of generating or maintaining the unlicensed interpretation resulted in 2 major age differences: Older adults were generally more likely to endorse the incorrect interpretation for sentences containing optionally transitive verbs (e.g., hunted, paid), and they showed decreased availability of the correct interpretation of subordinate clauses containing reflexive absolute transitive verbs (e.g., dress, bathe). These age differences may in part be linked to older adults' increased reli- ance on heuristic-like good-enough processing to compensate for age-related defi- cits in working memory capacity. The results support previous studies suggesting that syntactic reanalysis may not be an all-or-nothing process and might not be completed unless questions probing unresolved aspects of the sentence structure challenge the resultant interpretation.},

Using eye-movement monitoring, Experiment 3 showed that readers misanalysed when the verb preferentially did not take a noun-phrase object in normal reading. These results indicate that readers do not select an initial analysis for an unbounded dependency construction on the basis of subcategorisation frequency. Indeed, the preference for forming such dependencies as quickly as possible does not seem to be affected by the verb's subcategorisation preferences. We discuss the implications of the results for theories of parsing.},

The results of the present study suggest that these two phenomena reflect the same recognition memory process. The results suggest further that this is not because participants in studies of anaphor comprehension ignore the discourse properties of the stimulus materials and treat them as lists of words upon which memory tests are to be given. These results suggest that recognition processes play a role in anaphor comprehension and that such processes are in part the means by which repeated-noun anaphors are identified as such.},

abstract = {Articulatory and acoustic data were used to explore the following hypothesis for the vowel /u/: The objective of articulatory movements is an acoustic goal; varying and reciprocal contributions of different articulators may help to constrain acoustic variation in achieving the goal. Previous articulatory studies of similar hypotheses, expressed entirely in articulatory terms, have been confounded by interdependencies of the variables being studied (e.g., lip and mandible displacements). One case in which this problem may be minimized is that of lip rounding and tongue-body raising (formation of a velo-palatal constriction) for the vowel /u/. Lip rounding and tongue-body raising should have similar acoustic effects for /u/, mainly to lower F2. In multiple repetitions, reciprocal contributions of lip rounding and tongue-body raising could help limit F2 variability for /u/; thus this experiment looked for complementary covariation (negative correlations) in measures of these two parameters. An electro-magnetic midsagittal articulometer (EMMA) was used to track movements of midsagittal points on the tongue body, upper and lower lips, and mandible for large numbers of repetitions of utterances containing /u/. (Interpretation of the data was aided by results from area-function-to-formant modeling.) Three of four subjects showed weak negative correlations, tentatively supporting the hypothesis; a fourth showed the opposite pattern: positive correlations of lip rounding and tongue raising. The results are discussed with respect to ideas about motor equivalence, the nature of speech motor programming, and potential improvements to the paradigm.},

abstract = {Syntax is one of the components in the architecture of language processing that allows the listener/reader to bind single-word information into a unified interpretation of multiword utterances. This paper discusses ERP effects that have been observed in relation to syntactic processing. The fact that these effects differ from the semantic N400 indicates that the brain honors the distinction between semantic and syntactic binding operations. Two models of syntactic processing attempt to account for syntax-related ERP effects. One type of model is serial, with a first phase that is purely syntactic in nature (syntax-first model). The other type of model is parallel and assumes that information immediately guides the interpretation process once it becomes available. This is referred to as the immediacy model. ERP evidence is presented in support of the latter model. Next, an explicit computational model is proposed to explain the ERP data. This Unification Model assumes that syntactic frames are stored in memory and retrieved on the basis of the spoken or written word form input. The syntactic frames associated with the individual lexical items are unified by a dynamic binding process into a structural representation that spans the whole utterance. On the basis of a meta-analysis of imaging studies on syntax, it is argued that the left posterior inferior frontal cortex is involved in binding syntactic frames together, whereas the left superior temporal cortex is involved in retrieval of the syntactic frames stored in memory. Lesion data that support the involvement of this left frontotemporal network in syntactic processing are discussed.},

abstract = {When participants follow spoken instructions to pick up and move objects in a visual workspace, their eye movements to the objects are closely time-locked to referential expressions in the instructions. Two experiments used this methodology to investigate the processing of the temporary ambiguities that arise because spoken language unfolds over time. Experiment 1 examined the processing of sentences with a temporarily ambiguous prepositional phrase (e.g., "Put the apple on the towel in the box") using visual contexts that supported either the normally preferred initial interpretation (the apple should be put on the towel) or the less-preferred interpretation (the apple is already on the towel and should be put in the box). Eye movement patterns clearly established that the initial interpretation of the ambiguous phrase was the one consistent with the context. Experiment 2 replicated these results using prerecorded digitized speech to eliminate any possibility of prosodic differences across conditions or experimenter demand. Overall, the findings are consistent with a broad theoretical framework in which real-time language comprehension immediately takes into account a rich array of relevant nonlinguistic context.},

abstract = {Information theoretic measures of incremental parser load were generated from a phrase structure parser and a dependency parser and then compared with incremental eye movement metrics collected for the same temporarily syntactically ambiguous sentences, focussing on the disambiguating word. The findings show that the surprisal and entropy reduction metrics computed over a phrase structure grammar make good candidates for predictors of text readability for human comprehenders. This leads to a suggestion for the use of such metrics in Natural Language Generation (NLG).},

abstract = {This article examines the special processing characteristics of head-final relative clauses. As head-final relative clauses superficially resemble other prenominal modifiers such as adjectivals, stative verbs, and adjunctive/complement clauses, their status as a distinct kind has constantly been challenged. We present existing processing evidence to show that head-final relative clauses should be distinguished from other prenominal modifiers as they do involve structure-based filler-gap integrations (like those of head-initial relative clauses) and observe universal extraction effects. The evidence includes: (a) processing differences between possessive relative clauses and adverbial relative clauses in Mandarin; (b) processing differences between gapped relative clauses and adjunct clauses with null pronouns in Korean; and (c) subject-extracted relative clauses being easier to process than object-extracted relative clauses in head-final relativization.},

abstract = {Acinetobacter baumannii contains RND-family efflux systems AdeABC and AdeIJK, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the MIC changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. However, these studies may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by $\beta$-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied AcrAB-TolC system of Escherichia coli. We expressed adeABC and adeIJK of A. baumannii, as well as E. coli acrAB, in an E. coli host from which acrAB was deleted. The A. baumannii pumps were functional in E. coli, and the MIC changes that were observed largely confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. Thus, the AdeABC system pumped out all $\beta$-lactams, an activity that was often missed in deletion studies. When the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to a similar level for a comparison with AcrAB-TolC, we found that both A. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but AdeABC was less effective than AcrAB-TolC in the extrusion of lipophilic $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline efflux. AdeIJK was remarkably more effective than a similar level of AcrAB-TolC in the efflux of $\beta$-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was less so in the efflux of erythromycin. These results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the E. coli host.},

abstract = {Are morphological patterns learned in the form of rules? Some models deny this, attributing all morphology to analogical mechanisms. The dual mechanism model (Pinker, S., {\&} Prince, A. (1998). On language and connectionism: analysis of a parallel distributed processing model of language acquisition. Cognition, 28, 73-193) posits that speakers do internalize rules, but that these rules are few and cover only regular processes; the remaining patterns are attributed to analogy. This article advocates a third approach, which uses multiple stochastic rules and no analogy. We propose a model that employs inductive learning to discover multiple rules, and assigns them confidence scores based on their performance in the lexicon. Our model is supported over the two alternatives by new "wug test" data on English past tenses, which show that participant ratings of novel pasts depend on the phonological shape of the stem, both for irregulars and, surprisingly, also for regulars. The latter observation cannot be explained under the dual mechanism approach, which derives all regulars with a single rule. To evaluate the alternative hypothesis that all morphology is analogical, we implemented a purely analogical model, which evaluates novel pasts based solely on their similarity to existing verbs. Tested against experimental data, this analogical model also failed in key respects: it could not locate patterns that require abstract structural characterizations, and it favored implausible responses based on single, highly similar exemplars. We conclude that speakers extend morphological patterns based on abstract structural properties, of a kind appropriately described with rules. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while participants read sentences, some of which contained an anomalous word. In the critical sentences (e.g., The meal was devouring...), the syntactic cues unambiguously signaled an Agent interpretation of the subject noun, whereas the semantic cues supported a Theme interpretation. An Agent interpretation would render the main verb semantically anomalous (as meals do not devour things). Conversely, the Theme interpretation would render the main verb syntactically anomalous (as the -ED form, not the -ING form, is syntactically appropriate for this interpretation). We report that the main verbs in such sentences elicit the P600 effect associated with syntactic anomalies, rather than the N400 effect associated with semantic anomalies. We conclude that, at least under certain conditions, semantic information is "in control" of how words are combined during sentence processing.},

abstract = {(from the journal abstract) Although research has shown that priming negative stereotypes leads to lower performance among stigmatized individuals, little is understood about the cognitive mechanism that accounts for these effects. Three experiments tested the hypothesis that stereotype threat interferes with test performance because it reduces individuals' working memory capacity. Results show that priming self-relevant negative stereotypes reduces women's (Experiment 1) and Latinos' (Experiment 2) working memory capacity. The final study revealed that a reduction in working memory capacity mediates the effect of stereotype threat on women's math performance (Experiment 3). Implications for future research on stereotype threat and working memory are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2004 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {This article compares several methods of presenting text, including a new paradigm that produces reading-time data with many of the characteristics of naturally occurring eye-fixation data. In the new paradigm, called the moving window condition, a reader presses a button to see each successive work in a text, and the previous work is removed when a new work appears. The words appear in the same position that they would in normal test, and word-length information is available in peripheral vision. The results are qualitatively and quantitatively compared to the results obtained by monitoring the eye fixations of subjects reading normal text. The word-level effects are generally similar. Readers pause longer on longer words, on less frequent words, on words that introduce a new topic, and at ends of sentences. The results suggest that readers initiate thr processing of each word as soon as they encounter it rather than buffer words and delay processing. Also considered are two other reading-time paradigms, one in which words are cumulatively displayed on the screen and one in which each successive word is presented at the same location on the screen. Finally, we consider how the tendency to immediately process text might interact with other techniques for text presentation, such as the rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) condition, and we generate predictions about the nature and limits of the method.},

abstract = {The success of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks in language processing is typically attributed to their ability to capture long-distance statistical regularities. Linguistic regularities are often sensitive to syntactic structure; can such dependencies be captured by LSTMs, which do not have explicit structural representations? We begin addressing this question using number agreement in English subject-verb dependencies. We probe the architecture's grammatical competence both using training objectives with an explicit grammatical target (number prediction, grammaticality judgments) and using language models. In the strongly supervised settings, the LSTM achieved very high overall accuracy (less than 1{\%} errors), but errors increased when sequential and structural information conflicted. The frequency of such errors rose sharply in the language-modeling setting. We conclude that LSTMs can capture a non-trivial amount of grammatical structure given targeted supervision, but stronger architectures may be required to further reduce errors; furthermore, the language modeling signal is insufficient for capturing syntax-sensitive dependencies, and should be supplemented with more direct supervision if such dependencies need to be captured.},

abstract = {How should ecologists and evolutionary biologists analyze nonnormal data that involve random effects? Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize 'best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Much work has demonstrated so-called attraction errors in the production of subjectverb agreement (e.g., The key to the cabinets are on the table, Bock, J. K., {\&} Miller, C. A. (1991). Broken agreement. Cognitive Psychology, 23, 4593), in which a verb erroneously agrees with an intervening noun. Six self-paced reading experiments examined the online mech- anisms underlying the analogous attraction effects that have been shown in comprehen- sion; namely reduced disruption for subjectverb agreement violations when these attractor nouns intervene. One class of theories suggests that these effects are rooted in faulty representation of the number of the subject, while another class of theories suggests instead that such effects arise in the process of re-accessing subject number at the verb. Two main findings provide evidence against the first class of theories. First, attraction also occurs in relative clause configurations in which the attractor noun does not intervene between subject and verb and is not in a direct structural relationship with the subject head (e.g., The drivers who the runner wave to each morning). Second, we observe a grammatical asymmetry: attraction effects are limited to ungrammatical sentences, which would be unexpected if the representation of subject number were inherently prone to error. Weargue that agreement attraction in comprehension instead reflects a cue-based retrieval mechanism that is subject to retrieval errors. The grammatical asymmetry can be accounted for under one implementation that we propose, or if the mechanism is only called upon when the predicted agreement features fail to be instantiated on the verb.},

When these verbs occur with a complement that does not directly denote either an activity or an event (e.g. '... began the book' or '... enjoyed the book'), the complement must be type-shifted from an object to an activity to conform to the verb's semantic restrictions. We report an experiment in which self-paced reading times were found to be longer for complements that required type-shifting than for complements that directly matched the semantic restrictions of the matrix verb. This finding is argued to provide on-line evidence for a type of enriched lexical processing posited in recent lexical semantic research.},

The empirically oriented researcher will benefit from making Bayesian methods part of their statistical toolkit due to the many advantages of this framework, among them easier interpretation of results relative to research hypotheses, and flexible model specification. We present an informal introduction to the foundational ideas behind Bayesian data analysis, using, as an example, a linear mixed models analysis of data from a typical psycholinguistics experiment. We discuss hypothesis testing us-ing Bayes Factors, and model selection using cross-validation. We close with some examples illustrating the flexibility of model specification in the Bayesian framework. Suggestions for further reading are also provided.},

These observations are problematic because they may not be caused by the mental process under scrutiny or may not reflect the ability under examination. The problem is that a few outliers is sometimes enough to distort the group results (by altering the mean performance, by increasing variability, etc.). In this paper, various techniques aimed at detecting potential outliers are reviewed. These techniques are subdivided into two classes, the ones regarding univariate data and those addressing multivariate data. Within these two classes, we consider the cases where the population distribution is known to be normal, the population is not normal but known, or the population is unknown.

Differencesbetween bare singulars and plurals in languages without determinersare explained by treating bare nominals as kind terms. Differencesarise, it is argued, because singular and plural kinds relatedifferently to their instantiations. In languages with determiners,singular kinds typically occur with the definite determiner, butplural/mass kinds can be bare in some languages and definite inothers. An account of singular kinds in terms of taxonomic readingsis proposed, with number marking playing a crucial role inexplaining the obligatory presence of the determiner. The variationbetween languages with respect to plural/mass kinds is explained bypositing a universal scale of definiteness, with individual languageschoosing different cut-off points for lexicalization of the definitedeterminer. The possibility of further cross-linguistic variation isalso considered.},

Pronouns (er(masculine), sie(feminine)) that refer to a thing are determined by the syntactic gender of this thing (Garten [garden]masculine, Tasche [hand-bag]feminine). The study aimed to investigate whether semantic integration, syntactic integration, or both are involved in establishing co-reference between pronoun and subject/antecedent in sentences. Here we focused on two event-related potential components: the SPS/P600, related to syntactic violation and reanalysis, and the N400 component, related to semantic integration problems. In one condition, a person was introduced as antecedent and later referred to by a pronoun, which either agreed in biological/syntactic gender or not (biological/syntactic gender violation). In a second condition, a thing was introduced as antecedent and the corresponding pronoun either agreed in syntactic gender or not (syntactic gender violation). Results at critical pronouns showed a P600 effect for incongruent compared with congruent pronouns in both conditions with a centro-parietal maximum. This effect was larger for the person compared to the thing condition. We interpreted this finding as reflecting a syntactic integration process that can be influenced by conceptual/semantic and syntactic information of the antecedent type. Furthermore, at the word following the pronoun, we observed an N400 for the thing but not for the person condition. We suggest, supported by the results of a control experiment, that this effect reflects continuous integration processes for things, whereas for persons the integration seems to be finished at pronoun position.},

However, techniques for fitting distributions vary widely, and little is known about the efficacy of different techniques. In this article, we assess several fitting techniques by simulating six widely cited models of response time and using the fitting procedures to recover model parameters. The techniques include the maximization of likelihood and least squares fits of the theoretical distributions to different empirical estimates of the simulated dis- tributions. A running example is used to illustrate the different estimation and fitting procedures. The sim- ulation studies reveal that empirical density estimates are biased even for very large sample sizes. Some fitting techniques yield more accurate and less variable parameter estimates than do others. Methods that involve least squares fits to density estimates generally yield very poor parameter estimates.},

The target stimuli appeared in a circle divided into 8 equivalent parts. Presentation of the stimuli rotated clockwise. Participants performed the switching task at both a short (200 ms) and a long (1,000 ms) preparatory interval. Although the participants with CHI exhibited slower response times and greater switch costs, similar to controls, additional preparatory time reduced the switch costs, and the switch costs were limited to the 1st trial in the run. These findings indicate that participants with severe CHI were able to take advantage of time to prepare for the task switch, and the executive control processes involved in the switch costs were completed before the 1st trial of the run ended.},

abstract = {Judgments of linguistic unacceptability may theoretically arise from either grammatical deviance or significant processing difficulty. Acceptability data are thus naturally ambiguous in theories that explicitly distinguish formal and functional constraints. Here, we consider this source ambiguity problem in the context of Superiority effects: the dispreference for ordering a wh-phrase in front of a syntactically "superior" wh-phrase in multiple wh-questions, e.g. What did who buy? More specifically, we consider the acceptability contrast between such examples and so-called D-linked examples, e.g. Which toys did which parents buy? Evidence from acceptability and self-paced reading experiments demonstrates that (i) judgments and processing times for Superiority violations vary in parallel, as determined by the kind of wh-phrases they contain, (ii) judgments increase with exposure while processing times decrease, (iii) reading times are highly predictive of acceptability judgments for the same items, and (iv) the effects of the complexity of the wh-phrases combine in both acceptability judgments and reading times. This evidence supports the conclusion that D-linking effects are likely reducible to independently motivated cognitive mechanisms whose effects emerge in a wide range of sentence contexts. This in turn suggests that Superiority effects, in general, may owe their character to differential processing difficulty.},

The model gave a good account of all of the dependent variables--accuracy, correct and error response times, and their distributions--and provided a description of how the component processes involved in the lexical decision task were affected by experimental variables. All of the variables investigated affected the rate at which information was accumulated from the stimuli--called drift rate in the model. The different drift rates observed for the various classes of stimuli can all be explained by a 2-dimensional signal-detection representation of stimulus information.

Against this background we review a range of influential findings on reflexive comprehension, focusing on results that concern the speed and grammatical accuracy of antecedent retrieval. We propose that existing data, across languages and across methodologies, suggest that comprehenders retrieve a reflexive's antecedent primarily on the basis of its syntactic position, with morphological or discourse constraints evaluated subsequent to retrieval. We close by reviewing distinct retrieval mechanisms that are compatible with this claim, and suggest that a syntactic search mechanism provides a parsimonious explanation of existing data},

abstract = {Five experiments measured reading time for Spanish and English sentences containing a complex NP followed by a relative clause (e.g., ... "the daughter of the colonel who had an accident"). As has been previously reported, Spanish sentences were read more rapidly when the content of the relative clause forced it to modify the first of the two NPs in the complex NP ("the daughter") than when it modified the second NP ("the colonel"). Their English translations showed no difference in reading time. This preference to take the first noun as a host for the relative clause in Spanish occurred whether the relative clause was disambiguated by morphological gender marking or by its content. The results are generally consistent with the claim that the Late Closure parsing strategy does not apply universally across languages. However, we propose an alternative hypothesis, namely, that the Late Closure parsing strategy fails to apply across all phrase types within a language, and applies to relative clauses in neither English nor Spanish. Instead, a different principle, which we term the "construal hypothesis", accounts for processing of phrases such as relative clauses which do not play the role of a "primary relation" within a sentence.},

abstract = {Processing information in working memory requires selective access to a subset of working-memory contents by a focus of attention. Complex cognition often requires joint access to 2 items in working memory. How does the focus select 2 items? Two experiments with an arithmetic task and 1 with a spatial task investigate time demands for successive operations that involve 2 digits or 2 spatial positions, respectively. When both items used in an operation have been used in the preceding operation, latencies are shortened. No such repetition benefit (arithmetic) or a much smaller benefit (spatial) was found when only 1 item was repeated. The results rule out serial access to the 2 items, parallel access by expanding the focus, and parallel access by splitting the focus. They support the notion that 2 items are accessed by chunking them, so that they fit a focus limited to 1 chunk. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2009 APA, all rights reserved).},

@article{Jurafsky1996a,
abstract = {The problems of access retrieving linguistic structure from some mental grammar and disambiguation choosing among these structures to correctly parse ambiguous linguistic input are fundamental to language understanding. The literature abounds with psychological results on lexical access, the access of idioms, syntactic rule access, parsing preferences, syntactic disambiguation, and the processing of garden-path sentences. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to combine models which account for these results to build a general, uniform model of access and disambiguation at the lexical, idiomatic, and syntactic levels. For example psycholinguistic theories of lexical access and idiom access and parsing theories of syntactic rule access have almost no commonality in methodology or coverage of psycholinguistic data. This paper presents a single probabilistic algorithm which models both the access and disambiguation of linguistic knowledge. The algorithm is based on a parallel parser which ranks constructions for access, and interpretations for disambiguation, by their conditional probability. Low-ranked constructions and interpretations are pruned through beam-search; this pruning accounts, among other things, for the garden-path effect. I showthat thismotivated probabilistic treatment accounts for a wide variety of psycholinguistic results, arguing for a more uniform representation of linguistic knowledge and for the use of probabilistically enriched grammars and interpreters as models of human knowledge of and processing of language.},

abstract = {Three eye-tracking experiments investigated online processing of novel noun-noun compounds. The experiments compared processing of compounds that are difficult to interpret in isolation (e.g., dictionary treatment) and more easily interpretable adjective-noun and noun-noun sequences (e.g., rough treatment and torture treatment). In all three experiments, first-pass reading time was longer on the head noun (treatment) when it occurred in a difficult compound. Further, a preceding sentence that provided a potential interpretation of the critical compound reduced processing difficulty, but this modulation by context occurred in later eye movement measures, or downstream of the compound itself. These results are interpreted in relation to the eye movement literature on the processing of implausibility, which demonstrates a similar pattern in which the disruption in early eye movement measures is not alleviated by context, but context does have a later effect. The results also suggest that the interpretation of noun-noun compounds in context does initially depend on the availability of an out-of-context interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright The Experimental Psychology Society.},

abstract = {Judgments about the grammaticalitylacceptability of sentences are the most widely used data source in the syntactic literature. Typically, syntacticians rely on their own judgments, or those of a small number of colleagues. Although a number of researchers have argued that this is problematic, there is little research which systematically compares professional linguists' intuitions with those of linguistically naive speakers. This article examines linguists' and nonlinguists' judgments about one particular structure: questions with long distance dependencies. Linguists' judgments are shown to diverge from those of nonlinguists. These differences could be due to theoretical commitments (the conviction that linguistic processes apply 'across the board', and hence all sentences with the same syntactic structure should be equally grammatical) or to differences in exposure (the constructed examples of this structure found in the syntactic literature are very unrepresentative of ordinary usage). Whichever of these explanations turns out to be correct, it is clear that linguists' judgments are not representative of the population as a whole, and hence syntacticians should not rely on their own intuitions when testing their theories.},

abstract = {three phenomena related to the eyes' landing position within words, (1) the optimal viewing position (OVP), (2) the preferred viewing position (PVP), and (3) the Fixation- Duration Inverted-Optimal Viewing Position (IOVP) Effect. The influence of several variables on parameters of the OVP, PVP and/or IOVP function was systematically explored: word length, launch site distance, word frequency, as well as five experimental manipulations. First, word center was identified as the OVP, that is the position within a word where refixation probability is minimal. With increasing launch site distance, however, the OVP was found to move towards the word beginning. Several possible causes of refixations were discussed. The issue of refixation saccade programming was extensively investigated, suggesting that pre-planned and directly controlled refixation saccades coexist. Second, PVP curves, that is landing position distributions, show that the eyes are systematically deviated from the OVP, due to visuomotor constraints. By far the largest influence on mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian PVP curve was exhibited by launch site distance. Third, it was investigated how fixation durations vary as a function of landing position. The IOVP effect was replicated: Fixations located at word center are longer than those falling near the edges of a word. The effect of word frequency and/or launch site distance on the IOVP function mainly consisted in a vertical displacement of the curve. The Fixation- Duration IOVP effect is intriguing because word center (the OVP) would appear to be the best place to fixate and process a word. A critical part of the current work was devoted to investigate the origin of the effect. It was suggested that the IOVP effect arises as a consequence of mislocated fixations, i.e. fixations on unintended words, which are caused by saccadic errors. An algorithm for estimating the proportion of mislocated fixations from empirical data was developed, based on extrapolations of landing position distributions beyond word boundaries. As a new central theoretical claim it was suggested that a new saccade program is started immediately if the intended target word is missed. On average, this will lead to decreased durations for mislocated fixations. Because mislocated fixations were shown to be most prevalent at the beginning and end of words, the proposed mechanism generated the inverted U- shape for fixation durations when computed as a function of landing position. The proposed mechanism for generating the effect is generally compatible with both oculomotor and cognitive models of eye-movement control in reading.},

abstract = {Microsaccades are one component of the small eye movements that constitute
fixation. Their implementation in the oculomotor system is unknown.
To better understand the physiological and mechanistic processes
underlying microsaccade generation, we studied microsaccadic inhibition,
a transient drop of microsaccade rate, in response to irrelevant
visual and auditory stimuli. Quantitative descriptions of the time
course and strength of inhibition revealed a strong dependence of
microsaccadic inhibition on stimulus characteristics. In Experiment
1, microsaccadic inhibition occurred sooner after auditory than after
visual stimuli and after luminance-contrast than after color-contrast
visual stimuli. Moreover, microsaccade amplitude strongly decreased
during microsaccadic inhibition. In Experiment 2, the latency of
microsaccadic inhibition increased with decreasing luminance contrast.
We develop a conceptual model of microsaccade generation in which
microsaccades result from fixation-related activity in a motor map
coding for both fixation and saccades. In this map, fixation is represented
at the central site. Saccades are generated by activity in the periphery,
their amplitude increasing with eccentricity. The activity at the
central, fixation-related site of the map predicts the rate of microsaccades
as well as their amplitude and direction distributions. This model
represents a framework for understanding the dynamics of microsaccade
behavior in a broad range of tasks.},

abstract = {Scalar implicatures are inferences that arise when a weak expression is used instead of a stronger alternative. For example, when a speaker says, " Some of the children are in the classroom," she often implies that not all of them are. Recent processing studies of scalar implicatures have argued that generating an implicature carries a cost. In this study we investigated this cost using a sentence verification task similar to that of Bott and Noveck (2004) combined with a response deadline procedure to estimate speed and accuracy independently. Experiment 1 compared implicit upper-bound interpretations (some [but not all]) with lower-bound interpretations (some [and possibly all]). Experiment 2 compared an implicit upper-bound meaning of some with the explicit upper-bound meaning of only some. Experiment 3 compared an implicit lower-bound meaning of some with the explicit lower-bound meaning of at least some. Sentences with implicatures required additional processing time that could not be attributed to retrieval probabilities or factors relating to semantic complexity. Our results provide evidence against several different types of processing models, including verification and nonverification default implicature models and cost-free contextual models. More generally, our data are the first to provide evidence of the costs associated with deriving implicatures per se. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

However, there have been no computational proposals for how people might use another powerful learning mechanism: generalization from learned to analogous distinctions (e.g., from /b/--/p/ to /g/--/k/). Here, we present a new simple model of generalization in phonetic category learning, formalized in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. The model captures our proposal that linguistic knowledge includes the possibility that category types in a language (such as voiced and voiceless) can be shared across sound classes (such as labial and velar), thus naturally leading to generalization. We present two sets of simulations that reproduce key features of human performance in behavioral experiments, and we discuss the model's implications and directions for future research.},

abstract = {This paper is divided into two major portions; the first outlines a general theoretical framework in which to view human memory, and the second describes the results of a number of experiments designed to test specific models that can be derived from the overall theory. The general theoretical framework, set forth in Sections II and III, categorizes the memory system along two major dimensions. One categorization distinguishes permanent, structural features of the system from control processes that can be readily modified or reprogrammed at the will of the subject. Because we feel that this distinction helps clarify a number of results, we will take time to elaborate it at the outset. The permanent features of memory, which will be referred to as the memory structure, include both the physical system and the built-in processes that are unvarying and fixed from one situation to another. Control processes, on the other hand, are selected, constructed, and used at the option of the subject and may vary dramatically from one task to another even though 'superficially the tasks may appear very similar. The use of a particular control process in a given situation will depend upon such factors as the nature of the instructions, the meaningfulness of the material, and the individual subject's history.},

abstract = {It is known that, on average, people adapt their choice of memory strategy to the subjective utility of interaction. What is not known is whether an individual's choices are boundedly optimal. Two experiments are reported that test the hypothesis that an individual's decisions about the distribution of remembering between internal and external resources are boundedly optimal where optimality is defined relative to experience, cognitive constraints, and reward. The theory makes predictions that are tested against data, not fitted to it. The experiments use a no-choice/choice utility learning paradigm where the no-choice phase is used to elicit a profile of each participant's performance across the strategy space and the choice phase is used to test predicted choices within this space. They show that the majority of individuals select strategies that are boundedly optimal. Further, individual differences in what people choose to do are successfully predicted by the analysis. Two issues are discussed: (a) the performance of the minority of participants who did not find boundedly optimal adaptations, and (b) the possibility that individuals anticipate what, with practice, will become a bounded optimal strategy, rather than what is boundedly optimal during training.},

We distinguish two versions of cumulativity, namely GANGING-UP CUMULATIVITY and COUNTING CUMULATIVITY. We will compare how Paul Boersma's (1998) version of stochastic OT on the one hand and Maximum entropy models on the other hand deal with cumulativity. The second part of the article reports empirical data on English genitive variation. It turns out that both versions of cumulativity obtain in the empirical data. In the last part of the article, we compare the predictions of the two theories with respect to this empirical domain. The maximum entropy model proves to be clearly superior, both with respect to the accuracy of its predictions and to its learnability properties.

Using experimental sentences preceded by referentially supportive contexts, they demonstrated a different pattern of results when regressive eye movements were eliminated from the data set than when regressions were included. The regression-contingent analysis that they used involves an implicit assumption that regressive eye movements are a necessary consequence of subjects' being garden pathed. We report some data which demonstrate that garden path effects are sometimes even stronger in the absence of regressions and, thus, argue that readers can be garden pathed without making regressions.},

abstract = {Speakers frequently make subject-verb number agreement errors in the presence of a local noun with a different number from the head of the subject phrase. A series of four experiments used a two-choice response time (RT) paradigm to investigate how the latency of correct agreement decisions is modulated by the presence of a number attractor, and to investigate the relative latency of errors and correct agreement decisions. The presence of a number attractor reliably increased correct RT, and the size of this RT effect was consistently larger in conditions that also had larger effects on accuracy. Number attraction errors, however, were similar in RT to correct responses in the same experimental condition. These results are interpreted as supporting a model according to which an intervening number attractor makes the agreement computation process more difficult in general [Eberhard, K. M., Cutting, J. C., {\&} Bock, K. (2005). Making sense of syntax: Number agreement in sentence production. Psychological Review 112, 531-559], with errors arising probabilistically. However, attraction from a non-intervening noun resulted in only mildly inflated correct RT, but dramatically inflated error RT, suggesting that non-intervening attraction errors may reflect confusion about the structure of the subject phrase. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Loftus:1994p761,
abstract = {We argue that to best comprehend many data sets, plotting judiciously selected sample statistics with associated confidence intervals can usefully supplement, or even replace, standard hypothesis-testing procedures. We note that most social science statistics textbooks limit discussion of confidence intervals to their use in between-subject designs. Our central purpose in this article is to describe how to compute an analogous confidence interval that can be used in within-subject designs. This confidence interval rests on the reasoning that because between-subject variance typically plays no role in statistical analyses of within-subject designs, it can legitimately be ignored; hence, an appropriate confidence interval can be based on the standard within-subject error term-that is, on the variability due to the subject x condition interaction. Computation of such a confidence interval is simple and is embodied in Equation 2 on p. 482 of this article. This confidence interval has two useful properties. First, it is based on the same error term as is the corresponding analysis of variance, and hence leads to comparable conclusions. Second, it is related by a known factor ( radical2) to a confidence interval of the difference between sample means; accordingly, it can be used to infer the faith one can put in some pattern of sample means as a reflection of the underlying pattern of population means. These two properties correspond to analogous properties of the more widely used between-subject confidence interval.},

Three experiments show that comprehenders anticipate more than just On the other hand; rather, they keep track of embedded constituents and establish non-local dependencies. Our results show that comprehenders disprefer a subsequent contrast marked with On the other hand when a passage has already provided intervening content that establishes an appropriate contrast with On the one hand. Furthermore, comprehenders maintain their expectation for an upcoming contrast across intervening material, even if the embedded constituent itself contains contrast. The results are taken to support expectation-driven models of processing in which comprehenders posit and maintain structural representations of discourse structure.},

Evidence accumulation (or sequential sampling) models are the most successful theories of choice RT. These models all have the same "scaling" property--that a subset of their parameters can be multiplied by the same amount without changing their predictions. This property means that a single parameter must be fixed to allow the estimation of the remaining parameters. In the present article, we show that the traditional solution to this problem has overconstrained these models, unnecessarily restricting their ability to account for data and making implicit--and therefore unexamined--psychological assumptions. We show that versions of these models that address the scaling problem in a minimal way can provide a better description of data than can their overconstrained counterparts, even when increased model complexity is taken into account.},

using a new method: reverse correlation in the orientation domain.
Orientation tuning develops after a delay of 30-45 milliseconds and
persists for 40-85 ms. Neurons in layers 4C alpha or 4C beta, which
receive direct input from the thalamus, show a single orientation
preference which remains unchanged throughout the response period.
In contrast, the preferred orientations of output layer neurons (in
layers 2, 3, 4B, 5 or 6) usually change with time, and in many cases
the orientation tuning may have more than one peak. This difference
in dynamics is accompanied by a change in the sharpness of orientation
tuning; cells in the input layers are more broadly tuned than cells
in the output layers. Many of these observed properties of output
layer neurons cannot be explained by simple feedforward models, whereas
they arise naturally in feedback networks. Our results indicate that
V1 is more than a bank of static oriented filters; the dynamics of
output layer cells appear to be shaped by intracortical feedback.},

Here, we examine linguistic prediction from multiple perspectives, ranging from theoretical models that analyze predictability at the level of ambiguity resolu- tion, to experimental evidence primarily from event-related brain potentials (ERPs) that sup- ports a “strong” model of prediction in which items are not just incrementally integrated, but are wholly or featurally pre-activated via accruing mental sentential representations. We also explore possible consequences of a neural language parser (aka, brain) that may be prone to mispredicting, and what electrophysiological evidence for such processing may look like. We conclude by arguing for the importance of investigating such linguistic eff ects as yet another example of a neural system in which probability estimation is inherent, with a pro- posal to move beyond the debate of whether there is linguistic prediction, toward focusing research eff orts on how pre-activation may occur and what is pre-activated.},

This question was investigated by globally increasing and/or decreasing luminance or contrast in photographs of real-world scenes across saccadic eye movements or during matched brief interruptions in a flicker paradigm. The results from two experiments demonstrated very poor sensitivity to global image changes in both the saccade-contingent and flicker paradigms, suggesting that the specific values of basic sensory properties do not contribute to the perception of stability across saccades during complex scene perception. In addition, overall sensitivity was significantly worse in the saccade-contingent change paradigm than the flicker paradigm, suggesting that the flicker paradigm is an imperfect simulation of transsaccadic vision.},

In order to identify if the subjects of the infinitivals selected by these two verb types are syntactically identical (Movement Theory of Control) or distinct (Theory of Control by PRO or anaphora), the following features in the preambles were manipulated: gender of head noun (Feminine???Masculine), gender and number (Singular???Plural) of local noun, and type of verb (Control???Raising). We analyzed the agreement errors and omissions patterns, as well as response times in the production of the target adjective. The error rate was not different across the two syntactic conditions, but the two verb classes were associated with significantly different number of target omissions. Furthermore, omissions in the Control condition were specifically associated with feminine agreeing adjectives. This pattern was also reflected in the adjective production latency. Taken together, these results undermine the Control by Movement explanation and argue for a Control by PRO analysis of Control constructions.},

To investigate how this effect is manifested in distributional terms, an experiment was carried out in which subjects read each of 50 target words twice, once in a high-predictability context and once in a low-predictability context. The ex-Gaussian distribution was fit to each subject's first-fixation durations and single-fixation durations. For both measures, the $\mu$ parameter increased when a word was unpredictable, while the $\tau$ parameter was not significantly affected, indicating that a predictability manipulation shifts the distribution of fixation durations but does not affect the degree of skew. Vincentile plots showed that the mean ex-Gaussian parameters described the typical distribution shapes extremely well. These results suggest that the predictability and frequency effects are functionally distinct, since a frequency manipulation has been shown to influence both $\mu$ and $\tau$. The results may also be seen as consistent with the finding from single-word recognition paradigms that semantic priming affects only $\mu$.},

To explore their workings, we investigated how semantic integration, a type of conceptual relatedness, produces variations in agreement (Solomon {\&} Pearlmutter, 2004). These agreement variations are open to competing notional and lexical-grammatical number accounts. The notional hypothesis is that changes in number agreement reflect differences in referential coherence: More coherence yields more singularity. The lexical-grammatical hypothesis is that changes in agreement arise from competition between nouns differing in grammatical number: More competition yields more plurality. These hypotheses make opposing predictions about semantic integration. On the notional hypothesis, semantic integration promotes singular agreement. On the lexical-grammatical hypothesis, semantic integration promotes plural agreement. We tested these hypotheses with agreement elicitation tasks in two experiments. Both experiments supported the notional hypothesis, with semantic integration creating faster and more frequent singular agreement. This implies that referential coherence mediates the effect of semantic integration on number agreement.},

However, the "effective preparation period" may be longer than FP: nonspecific preparation may start prior to FP (e.g., at the onset of S1) and/or continue after it (i.e., in parallel with the reaction process). In four experiments, we factorially varied FP and an additional factor (S1-duration; S2-luminance; stimulus-response compatibility) that probed the effective preparation period outside the bounds of FP. By examining how equivalent RT-FP functions obtain at the different levels of the additional factor, we showed that nonspecific preparation (1) starts at the onset of S1 for brief FPs but at its offset for longer FPs and (2) continues in parallel with S2-encoding but stops prior to response selection.},

We find that despite having a richer morphology, Spanish speakers show reliable attraction effects in comprehension, and that these effects are strikingly similar to those previously found in English in their magnitude and distributional profile. Further, we use distributional analyses to argue that cue-based memory retrieval is used as an error-driven mechanism in comprehension.

Recent challenges to a fundamental assumption of generative linguistics-that universal properties of the human language acquisition faculty constrain the types of grammatical systems which can occur-suggest the need for new types of empirical evidence connecting typology to biases of learners. Using an artificial language learning paradigm in which adult subjects are exposed to a mix of grammatical systems (similar to a period of linguistic change), we show that learners' biases mirror a word-order universal, first proposed by Joseph Greenberg, which constrains typological patterns of adjective, numeral, and noun ordering. We briefly summarize the results of a probabilistic model of the hypothesized biases and their effect on learning, and discuss the broader implications of the results for current theories of the origins of cross-linguistic word-order preferences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The diffusion model for two-choice real-time decisions is applied to four psychophysical tasks. The model reveals how stimulus information guides decisions and shows how the information is processed through time to yield sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect decisions. Rapid two-choice decisions yield multiple empirical measures: response times for correct and error responses, the probabilities of correct and error responses, and a variety of interactions between accuracy and response time that depend on instructions and task difficulty. The diffusion model can explain all these aspects of the data for the four experiments we present. The model correctly accounts for error response times, something previous models have failed to do. Variability within the decision process explains how errors are made, and variability across trials correctly predicts when errors are faster than correct responses and when they are slower.},

We challenge this assumption and propose a new framework for studying pronoun resolution. Drawing on advances in discourse representation and global memory modeling, this framework suggests that automatic processes may not always identify a unique referent for a pronoun. In 9 experiments, we demonstrate that, unlike noun anaphors, pronouns sometimes do not produce relative facilitation of their referents in comparison with nonreferents. We argue that research on pronoun resolution must consider the discourse contexts in which pronouns are likely to occur.},

abstract = {A counterintuitive and theoretically important pattern of results in the visual word recognition literature is that both word frequency and stimulus quality produce large but additive effects in lexical decision performance. The additive nature of these effects has recently been called into question by Masson and Kliegl (in press), who used linear mixed effects modeling to provide evidence that the additive effects were actually being driven by previous trial history. Because Masson and Kliegl also included semantic priming as a factor in their study and recent evidence has shown that semantic priming can moderate the additivity of word frequency and stimulus quality (Scaltritti, Balota, {\&} Peressotti, 2012), we reanalyzed data from 3 published studies to determine if previous trial history moderated the additive pattern when semantic priming was not also manipulated. The results indicated that previous trial history did not influence the joint influence of word frequency and stimulus quality. More important, and independent of Masson and Kliegl's conclusions, we also show how a common transformation used in linear mixed effects analyses to normalize the residuals can systematically alter the way in which two variables combine to influence performance. Specifically, using transformed, rather than raw reaction times, consistently produces more underadditive patterns.},

I show that even after applying the arcsine-square-root transformation to proportional data, ANOVA can yield spurious results. I discuss conceptual issues underlying these problems and alternatives provided by modern statistics. Specifically, I introduce ordinary logit models (i.e. logistic regression), which are well-suited to analyze categorical data and offer many advantages over ANOVA. Unfortunately, ordinary logit models do not include random effect modeling. To address this issue, I describe mixed logit models (Generalized Linear Mixed Models for binomially distributed outcomes, Breslow {\&} Clayton, 1993), which combine the advantages of ordinary logit models with the ability to account for random subject and item effects in one step of analysis. Throughout the paper, I use a psycholinguistic data set to compare the different statistical methods.},

@article{Sedivy1999,
abstract = {While much work has been done investigating the role of context in the incremental processing of syntactic indeterminacies, relatively little is known about online semantic interpretation. The experiments in this article made use of the eye-tracking paradigm with spoken language and visual contexts in order to examine how, and when listeners make use of contextually-defined contrast in interpreting simple prenominal adjectives. Experiment 1 focused on intersective adjectives. Experiment 1A provided further evidence that intersective adjectives are processed incrementally. Experiment 1B compared response times to follow instructions such as 'Pick up the blue comb' under conditions where there were two blue objects (e.g. a blue pen and a blue comb), but only one of these objects had a contrasting member in the display. Responses were faster to objects with a contrasting member, establishing that the listeners initially assume a contrastive interpretation for intersective adjectives. Experiments 2 and 3 focused on vague scalar adjectives examining the time course with which listeners establish contrast for scalar adjectives such as tall using information provided by the head noun (e.g. glass) and information provided by the visual context. Use of head-based information was examined by manipulating the typicality of the target object (e.g. whether it was a good or poor example of a tall glass. Use of context-dependent contrast was examined by either having only a single glass in the display (the no contrast condition) or a contrasting object (e.g. a smaller glass). The pattern of results indicated that listeners interpreted the scalar adjective incrementally taking into account context-specific contrast prior to encountering the head. Moreover, the presence of a contrasting object, sharply reduced, and in some conditions completely eliminated, typicality effects. The results suggest a language processing system in which semantic interpretation, as well as syntactic processing, is conducted incrementally, with early integration of contextual information.},

While the case-matching hypothesis predicts that relative clauses are preferentially attached to NPs whose case matches that of the relative pronoun, attachment binding predicts that NPs are preferentially attached to the most salient host, that is NP1 in constructions with two NPs. We conducted two off-line studies, one sentence completion task and one magnitude estimation experiment using subject (nominative pronoun) and object (accusative pronoun) relative clauses that can be attached to either of the two nouns in a complex subject (NP1 = nominative, NP2 = genitive) or object NP (NP1 = accusative, NP2 = genitive). While attachment binding predicts an across-the-board NP1 preference, the case-matching hypothesis predicts an NP1 prefence only in the case of subject (object) NPs followed by subject (object) relative clauses. The results of both experiments provide evidence for attachment binding and against case matching.},

abstract = {In the literature dealing with the reanalysis of garden path sentences such as While the man hunted the deer ran into the woods, it is generally assumed either that people completely repair their initial incorrect syntactic representations to yield a final interpretation whose syntactic structure is fully consistent with the input string or that the parse fails. In a series of five experiments, we explored the possibility that partial reanalyses take place. Specifically, we examined the conditions under which part of the initial incorrect analysis persists at the same time that part of the correct final analysis is constructed. In Experiments 1a and 1b, we found that both the length of the ambiguous region and the plausibility of the ultimate interpretation affected the likelihood that such sentences would be fully reanalyzed. In Experiment 2, we compared garden path sentences with non-garden path sentences and compared performance on two different types of comprehension questions. In Experiments 3a and 3b, we constructed garden path sentences using a small class of syntactically unique verbs to provide converging evidence against the position that people employ some sort of "general reasoning" or pragmatic inference when faced with syntactically difficult garden paths. The results from these experiments indicate that reanalysis of such sentences is not always complete, so that comprehenders often derive an interpretation for the full sentence in which part of the initial misanalysis persists. We conclude that the goal of language processing is not always to create an idealized structure, but rather to create a representation that is "good enough" to satisfy the comprehender that an appropriate interpretation has been obtained. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of five experiments designed to investigate the effects of referential processing on sentence complexity. Gibson (Cognition, 68 (1998) 1) suggested that sentence complexity is related to the locality of integrations between dependent syntactic heads, and that an appropriate measure of locality is the number of new discourse referents intervening between the endpoints of those integrations. The experiments in this paper test, modify and extend Gibson's (1998) claims. Each experiment manipulated noun phrases (NPs) in the subject positions of object-extracted relative clauses in order to determine how different types of NPs affected sentence complexity. Experiments 1, 2 and 3 used questionnaires to gauge sentence complexity, whereas Experiments 4 and 5 used self-paced reading. The results from Experiments 1, 2, 4 and 5 suggest that the complexity of the experimental items was more closely related to the Givenness status of the embedded subject in the Givenness Hierarchy than to whether the embedded subject was old or new to the discourse. Experiment 3 compared materials in which a quantifier was rotated through subject positions of a nested relative clause structure. The results of this experiment support a discourse-processing-based distance metric for computing locality and provide evidence against a pure similarity-based account of structural complexity such as proposed by Bever (Bever, T.

Although the causes and solutions are varied, we focus here on a common logical problem in inference. The default mode of inference is significance testing, which has a free lunch property where researchers need not make detailed assumptions about the alternative to test the null hypothesis. We present the argument that there is no free lunch; that is, valid testing requires that researchers test the null against a well-specified alternative. We show how this requirement fol-lows from the basic tenets of conventional and Bayesian probability. Moreover, we show in both the conventional and Bayesian framework that not specifying the alternative may lead to rejections of the null hypothesis with scant evidence. We review both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to specifying alternatives, and we show how such specifications improve inference. The field of cognitive science will benefit because consideration of reasonable alternatives will undoubtedly sharpen the intellectual underpinnings of research.},

@article{Meyer1988,
abstract = {Mental chronometry, in which conclusions about human information processing are reached through measures of subjects' reaction time, has contributed substantially to studies of cognition and action. During the evolution of the chronometric paradigm, several key issues have emerged. The issues concern (a) the existence of separable processing stages, (b) the degree to which various stages of processing produce partial outputs before they are completed, and (c) the discrete versus continuous form of the outputs. To obtain added temporal resolution, new reaction-time procedures have been developed, including special response-priming and speed-accuracy decomposition techniques that focus on quantitative patterns of reaction-time distributions and error rates. The present article summarizes these developments, starting with a historical review of chronometric research and proceeding to a survey of recent empirical and theoretical innovations. We also discuss the relevance and potential future impact of complementary work by cognitive psychophysiologists on event-related brain potentials and other physiological variables. ?? 1988.},

abstract = {Over the last four decades, sequential accumula- tion models for choice response times have spread through cognitive psychology like wildfire. The most popular style of accumulator model is the diffusion model (Ratcliff Psychological Review, 85, 59–108, 1978), which has been shown to account for data from a wide range of paradigms, including perceptual discrimination, letter identification, lexical decision, recognition memory, and signal detection. Since its original inception, the model has become increas- ingly complex in order to account for subtle, but reliable, data patterns. The additional complexity of the diffusion model renders it a tool that is only for experts. In response, Wagenmakers et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin {\&} Review, 14, 3–22, 2007) proposed that researchers could use a more basic version of the diffusion model, the EZ diffusion. Here, we simulate experimental effects on data generated from the full diffusion model and compare the power of the full diffusion model and EZ diffusion to detect those effects. We show that the EZ diffusion model, by virtue of its relative simplicity, will be sometimes better able to detect experimental effects than the data–generating full diffusion model.},

The advantages of LMMs over ANOVAs, however, come at a cost: Setting up an LMM is not as straightforward as running an ANOVA. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr et al., 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal {\$}\backslashalpha{\$} in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, models with a random effect structure that is supported by the data have optimal Type I error and power properties.},

abstract = {This paper is a sequel to an earlier paper which proposed an active
role for the thalamus, integrating multiple hypotheses formed in
the cortex via the thalamo-cortical loop. In this paper, I put forward
a hypothesis on the role of the reciprocal, topographic pathways
between two cortical areas, one often a 'higher' area dealing with
more abstract information about the world, the other 'lower', dealing
with more concrete data. The higher area attempts to fit its abstractions
to the data it receives from lower areas by sending back to them
from its deep pyramidal cells a template reconstruction best fitting
the lower level view. The lower area attempts to reconcile the reconstruction
of its view that it receives from higher areas with what it knows,
sending back from its superficial pyramidal cells the features in
its data which are not predicted by the higher area. The whole calculation
is done with all areas working simultaneously, but with order imposed
by synchronous activity in the various top-down, bottom-up loops.
Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed.
A third part of this paper will deal with extensions of these ideas
to the frontal lobe.},

abstract = {Explaining the variation between human languages and the constraints on that variation is a core goal of linguistics. In the last 20 y, it has been claimed that many striking universals of cross-linguistic variation follow from a hypothetical principle that dependency length-the distance between syntactically related words in a sentence-is minimized. Various models of human sentence production and comprehension predict that long dependencies are difficult or inefficient to process; minimizing dependency length thus enables effective communication without incurring processing difficulty. However, despite widespread application of this idea in theoretical, empirical, and practical work, there is not yet large-scale evidence that dependency length is actually minimized in real utterances across many languages; previous work has focused either on a small number of languages or on limited kinds of data about each language. Here, using parsed corpora of 37 diverse languages, we show that overall dependency lengths for all languages are shorter than conservative random baselines. The results strongly suggest that dependency length minimization is a universal quantitative property of human languages and support explanations of linguistic variation in terms of general properties of human information processing.},

Recent findings suggest that they are integrated into 'object files', episodic bindings of object-related information. However, the problem of integrating distributed codes is not restricted to perception but applies to action planning and sensorimotor processing as well. Here I argue that the brain addresses these problems by creating multi-layered networks of bindings - 'event files' - that temporarily link codes of perceptual events, the current task context, and the actions performed therein. These bindings produce systematic but often surprising and counter-intuitive interactions between, and impairments in, perception and action planning.},

We develop a random walk/diffusion theory-2-stage dynamic signal detection (2DSD) theory-that accounts for all 3 measures using a common underlying process. The model uses a drift diffusion process to account for choice and decision time. To estimate confidence, we assume that evidence continues to accumulate after the choice. Judges then interrupt the process to categorize the accumulated evidence into a confidence rating. The model explains all known interrelationships between the 3 indices of performance. Furthermore, the model also accounts for the distributions of each variable in both a perceptual and general knowledge task. The dynamic nature of the model also reveals the moderating effects of time pressure on the accuracy of choice and confidence. Finally, the model specifies the optimal solution for giving the fastest choice and confidence rating for a given level of choice and confidence accuracy. Judges are found to act in a manner consistent with the optimal solution when making confidence judgments.},

abstract = {In the broad field of psycholinguistics, the modeling of language processing has evolved into a prominent subfield over the last couple of decades that now exerts substantial influence on the direction of the discipline (Christiansen {\&} Chater, 2001). It has sparked new ways of thinking about how language is produced and perceived, most notably in the context of localist connectionist models. With these positive developments have come new challenges, such as devising tests to distinguish among competing models. The experimental method has proven to be well-suited for testing theoretical assumptions from which computational models are built. Differences between models can lead to contrasting qualitative predictions across experimental conditions, such as two main effects for one model and an interaction for its competitor. When successful, this method of model testing can yield evidence that convincingly discriminates between models. Because such definitive tests are not always possible, researchers must explore the intricacies and nuances of the models' in order to identify conditions in which the models could be discriminated. This can be very much a hit-and-miss undertaking because most language processing models are often sufficiently complex that it is difficult to understand, let alone anticipate their full range of behaviors. Two consequences of this are evident in the literature. One is the discovery of an emergent property of a model, whereby it exhibits a behavior that was not purposefully or knowingly built into it. The model always possessed the behavior, but 2 PITT {\&} NAVARRO the difficulty in understanding the full consequences of our design choices when building the model can leave us unaware of some of its capabilities. A related problem, which shows up too often in the broader cognitive science literature, is making what seems like a reasonable qualitative prediction about model performance that turns out to be wrong. For example, a researcher may collect what appear to be compelling data against a model (e.g., double dissociation), only to be shown afterwards through simulations or data fitting that the model in question can indeed produce the observed pattern of results. Because it is difficult to discern the full capabilities of one model, let alone assess the similarities and differences of two, experiments that clearly discriminate between two models are not as common as one would like. An additional challenge has to do with the incremental approach to model development. Results that once discriminated between two models will no longer do so after the inferior model is modified to accommodate new data. Although this process should result in the models converging on the design of the language system, the similarity is functional, not necessarily structural. That is, the models will perform similarly across many testing situations (i.e., fit data or simulate phenomena), but be architecturally different. Performance differences to distinguish such models can be difficult to find. In this chapter, we introduce two methods for comparing quantitative models that can assist in tackling the aforementioned problems. The first focuses on inspecting the properties of the model itself to learn about its built-in power to simulate results. In the second, we introduce a method for identifying an experimental design that has the potential to distinguish between pairs of models.},

abstract = {This article discusses three statistical paradoxes that pervade epidemiological research: Simpson's paradox, Lord's paradox, and suppression. These paradoxes have important implications for the interpretation of evidence from observational studies. This article uses hypothetical scenarios to illustrate how the three paradoxes are different manifestations of one phenomenon--the reversal paradox--depending on whether the outcome and explanatory variables are categorical, continuous or a combination of both; this renders the issues and remedies for any one to be similar for all three. Although the three statistical paradoxes occur in different types of variables, they share the same characteristic: the association between two variables can be reversed, diminished, or enhanced when another variable is statistically controlled for. Understanding the concepts and theory behind these paradoxes provides insights into some controversial or contradictory research findings. These paradoxes show that prior knowledge and underlying causal theory play an important role in the statistical modelling of epidemiological data, where incorrect use of statistical models might produce consistent, replicable, yet erroneous results.},

Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants read sentences with grammatical and ungrammatical verbs, in which the plurality of the subject noun phrase was either doubly marked (via overt plural quantification and morphological marking on the noun) or singly marked (via only plural morphology on the noun). Both acceptability judgments and the ERP data showed heightened sensitivity to agree-ment violations when quantification provided an additional cue to the grammatical number of the subject noun phrase, over and above plural morphology. This is consistent with models of grammatical comprehension that emphasize fea-ture prediction in tandem with cue-based memory retrieval. Our results additionally contrast with those of prior studies that showed no effects of plural quantification on agreement in language production. These findings therefore highlight some nontrivial divergences in the cues and mechanisms supporting morphosyntactic processing in language production and comprehension.},

Experiment 1 investigated the effects of a concurrent working memory load and found that with no load or a small memory load many Low Span readers comprehended object relative sentences very poorly although their reading times in the critical area of these sentences were greater than those of High Span subjects. Experiment 2 replicated the reading time effects of Experiment 1 for object relative sentences and showed that pragmatic information improved the comprehension of the lower capacity readers, although their use of this information was limited to the clause in which it was presented.},

abstract = {In Russian negative sentences the verb's direct object may appear either in the accusative case, which is licensed by the verb (as is common cross-linguistically), or in the genitive case, which is licensed by the negation (Russian-specific “genitive-of- negation” phenomenon). Such sentences were used to investigate whether case marking is employed for anticipating syntactic structure, and whether lexical heads other than the verb can be predicted on the basis of a case-marked noun phrase. Experiment 1, a completion task, confirmed that genitive-of-negation is part of Russian speakers' active grammatical repertoire. In Experiments 2 and 3, the genitive/accusative case manipulation on the preverbal object led to shorter reading times at the negation and verb in the genitive versus accusative condition. Furthermore, Experiment 3 manipulated linear order of the direct object and the negated verb in order to distinguish whether the abovementioned facilitatory effect was predictive or integrative in nature, and concluded that the parser actively predicts a verb and (otherwise optional) negation on the basis of a preceding genitive-marked object. Similarly to a head-final language, case-marking information on preverbal noun phrases (NPs) is used by the parser to enable incremental structure building in a free-word-order language such as Russian.},

abstract = {When evaluating cognitive models based on fits to observed data (or, really, any model that has free parameters), parameter estimation is critically important. Traditional techniques like hill climbing by minimizing or maximizing a fit statistic often result in point estimates. Bayesian approaches instead estimate parameters as posterior probability distributions, and thus naturally account for the uncertainty associated with parameter estimation; Bayesian approaches also offer powerful and principled methods for model comparison. Although software applications such as WinBUGS (Lunn, Thomas, Best, {\&} Spiegelhalter, Statistics and Computing, 10, 325–337, 2000) and JAGS (Plummer, 2003) provide “turnkey”-style packages for Bayesian inference, they can be inefficient when dealing with models whose parameters are correlated, which is often the case for cognitive models, and they can impose significant technical barriers to adding custom distributions, which is often necessary when implementing cognitive models within a Bayesian framework. A recently developed software package called Stan (Stan Development Team, 2015) can solve both problems, as well as provide a turnkey solution to Bayesian inference. We present a tutorial on how to use Stan and how to add custom distributions to it, with an example using the linear ballistic accumulator model (Brown {\&} Heathcote, Cognitive Psychology, 57, 153–178. doi:                10.1016/j.cogpsych.2007.12.002                              , 2008).},

abstract = {Much work has demonstrated that speakers of verb-final languages are able to construct rich syntactic representations in advance of verb information. This may reflect general architectural properties of the language processor, or it may only reflect a language-specific adaptation to the demands of verb-finality. The present study addresses this issue by examining whether speakers of a verb-medial language (English) wait to consult verb transitivity information before constructing filler-gap dependencies, where internal arguments are fronted and hence precede the verb. This configuration makes it possible to investigate whether the parser actively makes representational commitments on the gap position before verb transitivity information becomes available. A key prediction of the view that rich pre-verbal structure building is a general architectural property is that speakers of verb-medial languages should predictively construct dependencies in advance of verb transitivity information, and therefore that disruption should be observed when the verb has intransitive subcategorization frames that are incompatible with the predicted structure. In three reading experiments (self-paced and eye-tracking) that manipulated verb transitivity, we found evidence for reading disruption when the verb was intransitive, although no such reading difficulty was observed when the critical verb was embedded inside a syntactic island structure, which blocks filler-gap dependency completion. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that in English, as in verb-final languages, information from preverbal noun phrases is sufficient to trigger active dependency completion without having access to verb transitivity information.},

For any company, being able to predict with some time which of their customers will churn is essential to take actions in order to retain them, and for this reason most sectors invest substantial effort in techniques for (semi) automatically predicting churning, and data mining and machine learning are among the techniques successfully used to this effect. In this paper we describe a prototype for churn prediction using stream mining methods, which offer the additional promise of detecting new patterns of churn in real-time streams of high-speed data, and adapting quickly to a changing reality. The prototype is implemented on top of the MOA (Massive Online Analysis) framework for stream mining. The application implicit in the prototype is the telecommunication operator (mobile phone) sector.},

abstract = {Is there underspecification in the syntactic phrase marker constructed during on-line sentence analysis? According to the construal hypothesis (Frazier {\&} Clifton, 1996), a very limited amount and type of structural underspecification is available to the human sentence parsing mechanism. Here we present the basic definitions of construal, illustrating the theory with some already published evidence. We also discuss several new pieces of evidence, from our laboratory and elsewhere, that support the construal hypothesis. We end by raising the question of what kind of mechanism operates in the process of interpreting a nonprimary phrase (a phrase that receives an underspecified syntactic analysis), and conclude that it is not a process of competition between multiple activated possible analyses but instead is a process in which the sheer existence of ambiguity need not result in increased processing cost.},

abstract = {Scanpaths have played an important role in classic research on reading behavior. Nevertheless, they have largely been neglected in later research perhaps due to a lack of suitable analytical tools. Recently, von der Malsburg and Vasishth (2011) proposed a new measure for quantifying differ-ences between scanpaths and demonstrated that this measure can recover effects that were missed with the traditional eyetracking measures. However, the sentences used in that study were difficult to process and scanpath effects accordingly strong. The purpose of the present study was to test the validity, sensitivity, and scope of applicability of the scanpath measure, using simple sentences that are typically read from left to right. We derived predictions for the regularity of scanpaths from the literature on oculomotor control, sentence processing, and cognitive aging and tested these predic-tions using the scanpath measure and a large database of eye movements. All predictions were con-firmed: Sentences with short words and syntactically more difficult sentences elicited more irregular scanpaths. Also, older readers produced more irregular scanpaths than younger readers. In addition, we found an effect that was not reported earlier: Syntax had a smaller influence on the eye move-ments of older readers than on those of young readers. We discuss this interaction of syntactic pars-ing cost with age in terms of shifts in processing strategies and a decline of executive control as readers age. Overall, our results demonstrate the validity and sensitivity of the scanpath measure and thus establish it as a productive and versatile tool for reading research.},

According to him this does not lead to any problems with two unmarked features (Nom and Acc) because the difference between these is represented structurally. There are two possibilities for why Case Attraction occurs, CAH or PFH. CAH (Case Attraction Hypothesis): (Marked) Case features *errnously* percolate to the wrong NP, i.e. antecedent of the relative pronoun. PFH (Parallel Function Hypothesis): Parallelism (in case) is an ambiguity resolution strategy applied by the parser. [I don't understand how this would help parsing, so I find it hard to call it an "ambiguity resolution strategy". Also the errnous vs. non-errnous distinction is pretty subjective. The crucial difference, however, is the the requirement of ambiguity.] Experiment 1: CAH vs. PFH Stimuli: Wir alle konnten gut verstehen, ... SO: (a) control dass unsere Chefin ... (unambiguous) (b) ambiguous dass Judith, der man uebrigens das Auto geklaut hat, ... with RC (c) unambiguous dass unsere Chefin, der man uebrigens das Auto geklaut hat, ... with RC ... ein so gutes Angebot annahm OS: (d) control dass unserer Chefin ... (unambiguous) (e) ambiguous dass Judith, die uebrigens wieder umgezogen ist, ... with RC (f) unambiguous dass unserer Chefin, die uebrigens wieder umgezogen ist, ... with RC ... ein so gutes Angebot schmeichelte Predictions: CAH: Difficulty in (b,c) compared to (a) and (e) compared to (d). Case Attraction in conditions (b,c), because RelPro is marked, the antecedent is not. Additional garden path in (e), because of the local ambiguity of 'Judith' together with the generic SO preference in German (Judith will be analyzed as subject at first). PFH: Same as CAH, but no difficulty in (c), because it is not compatible with dative. Results: SO OS (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) 92 77 74 85 85 85 - Accuracy 605 686 697 626 759 647 - Reaction Time Discussion: Bader sees PFH disconfirned, due to a difficuly in (c). [The SO preference predicted for (e) might be in RT instead of Accuracy, although it's a bit surprising.] [ However: The effects can be explained by complexity. In OS, even (Acc-initial) controls have a lower accuracy. Now, Dat-initial clauses might lead to even worse performance than Acc-initial ones. Thus, ]},

abstract = {Language comprehension requires recovering meaning from linguistic form, even when the mapping between the two is indirect. A canonical example is ellipsis, the omission of information that is subsequently understood without being overtly pronounced. Comprehension of ellipsis requires retrieval of an antecedent from memory, without prior prediction, a property which enables the study of retrieval in situ (Martin {\&} McElree, 2008, 2009). Sluicing, or inflectional-phrase ellipsis, in the presence of a conjunction, presents a test case where a competing antecedent position is syntactically licensed, in contrast with most cases of nonadjacent dependency, including verb-phrase ellipsis. We present speed-accuracy tradeoff and eye-movement data inconsistent with the hypothesis that retrieval is accomplished via a syntactically guided search, a particular variant of search not examined in past research. The observed timecourse profiles are consistent with the hypothesis that antecedents are retrieved via a cue-dependent direct-access mechanism susceptible to general memory variables. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Eye movement data have proven to be very useful for investigating human sentence processing. Eyetracking research has addressed a wide range of questions, such as recovery mechanisms following garden-pathing, the timing of processes driving comprehension, the role of anticipation and expectation in parsing, the role of semantic, pragmatic, and prosodic information, and so on. However, there are some limitations regarding the inferences that can be made on the basis of eye movements. One relates to the nontrivial interaction between parsing and the eye movement control system which complicates the interpretation of eye movement data. Detailed computational models that integrate parsing with eye movement control theories have the potential to unpack the complexity of eye movement data and can therefore aid in the interpretation of eye movements. Another limitation is the difficulty of capturing spatiotemporal patterns in eye movements using the traditional word-based eyetracking measures. Recent research has demonstrated the relevance of these patterns and has shown how they can be analyzed. In this review, we focus on reading, and present examples demonstrating how eye movement data reveal what events unfold when the parser runs into difficulty, and how the parsing system interacts with eye movement control.

Although theoretical semantics has a long history in linguistics and thus offers detailed and comprehensive models of the nature of semantic representations, these theories have had minimal impact on the brain investigation of semantic processing.

In this paper, we contribute to the ongoing discussion by looking at verb order variation in 3- and 4-verb clusters in German on the basis of new empirical evidence. First, we present several experiments that have used the method of speeded grammaticality judgments in order to determine the orders within a verb cluster that are accepted by native speakers.Amajor result of our experiments is that native speakers accept more orders than are allowed in Standard German. Second, we give a theoretical account of the data which applies and extendsWilliams' (2003) CAT-language. We show how the variation between Standard German and the more liberal Colloquial German that was revealed in our experiments follows from slightly different lexical entries within this system. Standard German is characterized by a complexity requirement on modal verb complements that restricts verb order variation. The more liberal Colloquial German system lacks this feature and thus allows a larger variation of verb orders.},

These lexical-syntactic attributes include grammatical gender (masculine/feminine/neuter), number (singular/plural) and countability (mass/count). While there has been considerable discussion regarding gender and number, relatively little attention has focused on countability. Therefore, this article reviews empirical evidence for lexical-syntactic specification of nouns for countability. This includes evidence from studies of language production and comprehension with normal speakers and case studies which assess impairments of mass/count nouns in people with acquired brain damage. Current theories of language processing are reviewed and found to be lacking specification regarding countability. Subsequently, the theoretical implications of the empirical studies are discussed in the context of frameworks derived from these accounts of language production (Levelt, 1989; Levelt et al., 1999) and comprehension (Taler and Jarema, 2006). The review concludes that there is empirical support for specification of nouns for countability at a lexical-syntactic level.},

abstract = {This study investigates brain responses to violations of information structure in wh-question-answer pairs, with particular emphasis on violations of focus assignment in it-clefts (It was the queen that silenced the banker). Two types of ERP responses in answers to wh-questions were found. First, all words in the focus-marking (cleft) position elicited a large positivity (P3b) characteristic of sentence-final constituents, as did the final words of these sentences, which suggests that focused elements may trigger integration effects like those seen at sentence end. Second, the focusing of an inappropriate referent elicited a smaller, N400-like effect. The results show that comprehenders actively use structural focus cues and discourse-level restrictions during online sentence processing. These results, based on visual stimuli, were different from the brain response to auditory focus violations indicated by pitch-accent [Hruska, C., Steinhauer, K., Alter, K., {\&} Steube, A. (2000).

working memory (WM) capacity task (operation span; Ospan) that is

correlates well with other measures of WM capacity and has both good
internal consistency (alpha = .78) and test–retest reliability (.83).
In addition, the automated version of Ospan (Aospan) was shown to
load on the same factor as two other WM measures. This WM capacity
factor correlated with a factor composed of fluid abilities measures.
The utility of the Aospan was further demonstrated by analyzing response
times (RTs) that indicated that RT measures obtained in the task
accounted for additional variance in predicting fluid abilities.
Our results suggest that Aospan is a reliable and valid indicator
of WM capacity that can be applied to a wide array of research domains.},

abstract = {The parameters of the human memory system constrain the operation of language comprehension processes. In the memory literature, both decay and interference have been proposed as causes of forgetting; however, while there is a long history of research establishing the nature of interference effects in memory, the effects of decay are much more poorly supported. Nevertheless, research investigating the limitations of the human sentence processing mechanism typically focus on decay-based explanations, emphasizing the role of capacity, while the role of interference has received comparatively little attention. This paper reviews both accounts of difficulty in language comprehension by drawing direct connections to research in the memory domain. Capacity-based accounts are found to be untenable, diverging substantially from what is known about the operation of the human memory system. In contrast, recent research investigating comprehension difficulty using a retrieval-interference paradigm is shown to be wholly consistent with both behavioral and neuropsychological memory phenomena. The implications of adopting a retrieval-interference approach to investigating individual variation in language comprehension are discussed.},

abstract = {Comprehenders can use rich contextual information to anticipate upcoming input on the fly, but recent findings suggest that salient information about argument roles may not impact verb prediction. We took advantage of the word order properties of Mandarin Chinese to examine the time course with which argument role information impacts verb prediction. We isolated the contribution of argument role information by manipulating the order of pre-verbal noun phrase arguments while holding lexical information constant, and we examined its effects on accessing the verb in long-term semantic memory by measuring the amplitude of the N400 component. Experiment 1 showed when the verb appeared immediately after its arguments, even strongly constraining argument role information failed to modulate the N400 response to the verb. An N400 effect emerged in Experiment 2 when the verb appeared at a greater delay. Experiment 3 corroborated the contrast between the first two experiments through a within-participants manipulation of the time interval between the arguments and the verb, by varying the position of an adverbial phrase. These results suggest time is a key factor governing how diverse contextual information contributes to predictions. Here argument role information is shown to impact verb prediction, but its effect is not immediate.},

abstract = {A number of recent studies have argued that grammatical illusions can arise in the process of completing linguistic dependencies, such that unlicensed material is temporarily treated as licensed due to the presence of a potential licensor that is semantically appropriate but in a syntactically inappropriate position. A frequently studied case involves illusory licensing of negative polarity items (NPIs) like ever and any, which must appear in the scope (i.e., c-command domain) of a negative element. Speakers often show intrusive licensing effects in sentences where an NPI is preceded but not c-commanded by a negative element, as in ( *)The restaurants that no newspapers have recommended in their reviews have ever gone out of business. Existing accounts of intrusive licensing have focused on the role of general memory retrieval processes. In contrast, we propose that intrusive licensing of NPIs reflects semantic/pragmatic processes that are more specific to NPI licensing. As a test of this claim, we present results from an ERP study that presents a structurally matched comparison of intrusive licensing in two types of linguistic dependencies, namely NPI licensing and the binding of reflexive anaphors like himself, and herself. In the absence of a potential licensor, both NPIs and reflexives elicit a P600 response, but whereas there is an immediate ERP analog of the intrusion effect for NPI licensing, no such effect is found for reflexive binding. This suggests that the NPI intrusion effect does not reflect general-purpose retrieval mechanisms.},

General NotesSpeakers often show intrusive licensing effects in sentences where an NPI is preceded but not c-commanded by a negative element, as in *The restaurants that no newspapers have recommended in their reviews have ever gone out of business.two types of linguistic dependencies, namely NPI licensing and the binding of reflexive anaphors like himself, and herselfA number of case studies have demonstrated faithfulness to grammatical constraints (e.g., Kazanina, Lau, Lieberman, Yoshida, {\{}{\&}{\}} Phillips, 2007; Stowe, 1986; Sturt, 2003; Traxler {\{}{\&}{\}} Pickering, 1996, among others), but there are also studies that suggest that the parser operates with somewhat less precision.Intrusion occurs when speakers retrieve non-target or structurally inappropriate items that share some measure of similarity with the appropriate target.Badecker and Straub (2002) and Kennison (2003) have found that inaccessible antecedents exerted an influence on the resolution of reflexives and pronouns.The results on intrusion effects in the processing of anaphoric dependencies offer a mixed picture of how accurately the retrieval system can target grammatically licit antecedents.previous studies have investigated intrusion effects in very different constructions, such as wh-questions, pronoun binding, subject-verb agreement, and licensing of negative polarity items (NPIs) such as any, ever, or lift a fingerAs will be argued below, NPI licensing relies heavily on the semantic and pragmatic properties of the sentences in which the NPIs occur (Chierchia, 2006; Fauconnier, 1975; Giannakidou, 1998; Israel, 2004; Kadmon {\{}{\&}{\}} Landman, 1993; Krifka, 1995). In contrast, reflexive binding reflects a process that more straightforwardly makes explicit reference to previously processed items and structure.At first glance NPI licensing shares important commonalities with the processing of anaphora, and with reflexives in particular. Both phenomena typically require a licensor in a structurally appropriate position.the human parser can use structural constraints to guide its operationsa number of studies indicate that when completing a wh-dependency, comprehenders are sensitive to island constraints, such that the well-known `active' gap construction mechanisms are inoperative in domains that span island boundaries (e.g., Phillips, 2006; Stowe, 1986; Traxler {\{}{\&}{\}} Pickering, 1996)A particularly relevant example for this study is an eye-tracking study by Sturt (2003) on the processing of reflexives like himself and herself, which demonstrated a retrieval mechanism that appears to immediately respect grammatical constraints on antecedents for reflexives.responses in the inaccessible licensor condition were both slower and less accurate than in the other two conditionsan N400 component was elicited in both ungrammatical conditionsVasishth et al. (2008) demonstrated faster reading times for sentences with an intrusive licensor than for sentences with no licensor, but only in later reading time measures such as second pass fixations.Vasishth, Lewis and their colleagues (Lewis, Vasishth, {\{}{\&}{\}} Van Dyke, 2006; Vasishth, Drenhaus, Saddy, {\{}{\&}{\}} Lewis, 2005) have argued that the intrusion effect in NPI licensing reflects a general cue-based memory retrieval mechanism that is sensitive to partial cue overlap(7a) shows that when an NPI is within the semantic scope of a negation, it can be licensed, even though it is not syntactically c-commanded by the negation. (7b) shows that the same is not true of reflexive binding, which requires the antecedent to c-command the reflexive.In (5a) the search yields a licensor that matches both cues, and in (5c) the search fails to find a match to either cue. In (5b) the search yields only a partially matched item---a semantically appropriate licensor that is in an inappropriate position. However, this partial cue overlap, coupled with stochastic fluctuation in base activation levels, may be sufficient for the structurally inaccessible licensor to be retrieved and treated as a licensor for the NPI ever on some percentage of trials.There is a broad consensus among current leading theories of negative polarity phenomena that NPI licensing reflects an interaction between the lexical properties of NPIs and the semantics and pragmatics of entire propositions (e.g., Chierchia, 2006; Fauconnier, 1975; Giannakidou, 1998; Israel, 2004; Kadmon {\{}{\&}{\}} Landman, 1993; Krifka, 1995; Ladusaw, 1992), rather than a direct structural relation between the NPI and a licensing item.much work in linguistics suggests that NPI licensing and reflexive binding involve substantially different relations. Specifically, whereas reflexive binding involves dependencies between two specific syntactic constituents, many studies of NPI licensing have concluded that NPIs are licensed by the semantics and pragmatics of entire propositions, rather than involving dependencies with specific lexical items.Since the reflexive binding relation is more easily classified as an item-to-item dependency it may be a better candidate for testing the predictions of a retrieval-based model such as ACT-R.The contrasting findings about NPI licensing and reference resolution may reflect the different methodologies that have been used across studies, or they may reflect fundamental differences in the two phenomenaIn this study, we compared the intrusion effect on NPI licensing and reflexive binding in the same structural configurations and in the same experiment, using ERP recordings, which offer a fine-grained and continuous measure of brain activity.wo sets of items, one set for the test of NPI licensing and another for the test of reflexive bindingtwo types of unacceptable sentence. The first type of unacceptable sentence contained no potential licensor for the NPI or reflexive, and the second type of unacceptable sentence contained a potential licensor in a structurally inappropriate positionThe two grammatical control conditions had NPI licensors (`no' and `very few') in main clause subject position. The two intrusive conditions included the same potential NPI licensors, but in the subject position of the relative clause. In the no licensor condition the NPI licensor was replaced with the quantifier most, which retains the quantificational force of the sentences used in the other conditions but fails to license NPIs.if the intrusive licensing effect appears in the ERP record as soon as any effect of ungrammaticality, then we may conclude that intrusion impedes the ability of speakers to detect grammatical errors, making a true `illusion of grammaticality'Since overt negation is a stereotypical licensor for NPIs, it is possible that intrusive licensing might reflect the high cooccurrence frequency between no and ever.In order to address the possibility that intrusive NPI licensing might reflect frequent lexical associations, we tested both the highly frequent licensor no and the less common licensor few (2{\%} cooccurrence frequency with ever).Previous studies have shown that gender-stereotyped nouns cause comprehender to make an early commitment to the gender of the referent, and that this commitment is strong enough to cause processing disruption upon reading a mismatching reflexive (Osterhout, Bersick, {\{}{\&}{\}} McLaughlin, 1997; Sturt, 2003).Among the 210 filler items, 150 had similar structures and used similar determiners to the NPI conditions, but without the NPI ever.with the gender stereotype of the main clause subject. In the two unacceptable conditions the reflexive violated the gender stereotype of the main clause subject (e.g., The butcher burnt herself).although the NPI materials and reflexive materials were structurally parallel, they were not lexically matchedSentences were presented one word at a time in black letters on a white screen in a 30-point Times New Roman font.Reflexives appeared 7 words after intrusive licensors, whereas NPIs appeared 11 words after intrusive licensors.revious studies of NPI processing suggest that the intrusive licensing effect is stable across varying numbers of words between the NPI and the potential licensor, and hence this difference is unlikely to be responsible for any qualitative differences in results between the two types of materials.8 conditions (5 NPI conditions, 3 reflexive conditions)participants were significantly less accurate on the intrusive conditions than on the grammatical and the no licensor conditionsAdditionally, participants responded significantly less accurately in the grammatical no condition than in the no licensor condition (t1(27) = 2.64, p

The first type of unacceptable sentence contained no potential licensor for the NPI or reflexive, and the second type of unacceptable sentence contained a potential licensor in a structurally inappropriate positionThe two grammatical control conditions had NPI licensors (`no' and `very few') in main clause subject position. The two intrusive conditions included the same potential NPI licensors, but in the subject position of the relative clause. In the no licensor condition the NPI licensor was replaced with the quantifier most, which retains the quantificational force of the sentences used in the other conditions but fails to license NPIs.if the intrusive licensing effect appears in the ERP record as soon as any effect of ungrammaticality, then we may conclude that intrusion impedes the ability of speakers to detect grammatical errors, making a true `illusion of grammaticality'Since overt negation is a stereotypical licensor for NPIs, it is possible that intrusive licensing might reflect the high cooccurrence frequency between no and ever.In order to address the possibility that intrusive NPI licensing might reflect frequent lexical associations, we tested both the highly frequent licensor no and the less common licensor few (2{\%} cooccurrence frequency with ever).Previous studies have shown that gender-stereotyped nouns cause comprehender to make an early commitment to the gender of the referent, and that this commitment is strong enough to cause processing disruption upon reading a mismatching reflexive (Osterhout, Bersick, {\{}{\&}{\}} McLaughlin, 1997; Sturt, 2003).Among the 210 filler items, 150 had similar structures and used similar determiners to the NPI conditions, but without the NPI ever.with the gender stereotype of the main clause subject. In the two unacceptable conditions the reflexive violated the gender stereotype of the main clause subject (e.g., The butcher burnt herself).although the NPI materials and reflexive materials were structurally parallel, they were not lexically matchedSentences were presented one word at a time in black letters on a white screen in a 30-point Times New Roman font.Reflexives appeared 7 words after intrusive licensors, whereas NPIs appeared 11 words after intrusive licensors.revious studies of NPI processing suggest that the intrusive licensing effect is stable across varying numbers of words between the NPI and the potential licensor, and hence this difference is unlikely to be responsible for any qualitative differences in results between the two types of materials.8 conditions (5 NPI conditions, 3 reflexive conditions)participants were significantly less accurate on the intrusive conditions than on the grammatical and the no licensor conditionsAdditionally, participants responded significantly less accurately in the grammatical no condition than in the no licensor condition (t1(27) = 2.64, p},

abstract = {The surprisal of a word on a probabilistic grammar constitutes a promisingcomplexity
metric for human sentence comprehension difficulty. Using twodifferent
grammar types, surprisal is shown to have an effect on ﬁxation durationsand
regression probabilities in a sample of German readers' eye movements,
thePotsdam Sentence Corpus. A linear mixed-effects model was used
to quantify theeffect of surprisal while taking into account unigram
frequency and bigram frequency(transitional probability), word length,
and empirically-derived word predictability;the so-called “early”
and “late” measures of processing difﬁculty both showedan effect
of surprisal. Surprisal is also shown to have a small but statisticallynon-signiﬁcant
effect on empirically-derived predictability itself. This work thusdemonstrates
the importance of including parsing costs as a predictor of comprehension
difficulty in models of reading, and suggests that a simple identiﬁcationof
syntactic parsing costs with early measures and late measures with
durations ofpost-syntactic events may be difﬁcult to uphold.},

abstract = {Experiment 1 examined whether the semantic transparency of an English unspaced compound word affected how long it took to process it in reading. Three types of opaque words were each compared with a matched set of transparent words (i.e. matched on the length and frequency of the constituents and the frequency of the word as a whole). Two sets of the opaque words were partially opaque: either the first constituent was not related to the meaning of the compound (opaque-transparent) or the second constituent was not related to the meaning of the compound (transparent-opaque). In the third set (opaque-opaque), neither constituent was related to the meaning of the compound. For all three sets, there was no significant difference between the opaque and the transparent words on any eye-movement measure. This replicates an earlier finding with Finnish compound words (Pollatsek {\&} Hy{\"{o}}n{\"{a}}, 2005) and indicates that, although there is now abundant evidence that the component constituents play a role in the encoding of compound words, the meaning of the compound word is not constructed from the parts, at least for compound words for which a lexical entry exists. Experiment 2 used the same compounds but with a space between the constituents. This presentation resulted in a transparency effect, indicating that when an assembly route is 'forced', transparency does play a role.},

abstract = {The article reports four experiments with complex-span tasks in which encoding of memory items alternates with processing of distractors. The experiments test two assumptions of a computational model of complex span, SOB-CS: (1) distractor processing impairs memory because distractors are encoded into working memory, thereby interfering with memoranda; and (2) free time following distractors is used to remove them from working memory by unbinding their representations from list context. Experiment 1 shows that distractors are erroneously chosen for recall more often than not-presented stimuli, demonstrating that distractors are encoded into memory. Distractor intrusions declined with longer free time, as predicted by distractor removal. Experiment 2 shows these effects even when distractors precede the memory list, ruling out an account based on selective rehearsal of memoranda during free time. Experiments 3 and 4 test the notion that distractors decay over time. Both experiments show that, contrary to the notion of distractor decay, the chance of a distractor intruding at test does not decline with increasing time since encoding of that distractor. Experiment 4 provides additional evidence against the prediction from distractor decay that distractor intrusions decline over an unfilled retention interval. Taken together, the results support SOB-CS and rule out alternative explanations. Data and simulation code are available on Open Science Framework: osf.io/3ewh7.},

abstract = {We present a detailed process theory of the moment-by-moment working-memory retrievals and associated control structure that subserve sentence comprehension. The theory is derived from the application of independently motivated principles of memory and cognitive skill to the specialized task of sentence parsing. The resulting theory construes sentence processing as a series of skilled associative memory retrievals modulated by similarity-based interference and fluctuating activation. The cognitive principles are formalized in computational form in the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) architecture, and our process model is realized in ACT-R. We present the results of 6 sets of simulations: 5 simulation sets provide quantitative accounts of the effects of length and structural interference on both unambiguous and garden-path structures. A final simulation set provides a graded taxonomy of double center embeddings ranging from relatively easy to extremely difficult. The explanation of center-embedding difficulty is a novel one that derives from the model's complete reliance on discriminating retrieval cues in the absence of an explicit representation of serial order information. All fits were obtained with only 1 free scaling parameter fixed across the simulations; all other parameters were ACT-R defaults. The modeling results support the hypothesis that fluctuating activation and similarity-based interference are the key factors shaping working memory in sentence processing. We contrast the theory and empirical predictions with several related accounts of sentence-processing complexity.},

abstract = {In German, oblique Cases (dative and genitive) require morphological licensing while structural Cases (nominative and accusative) do not. This difference can be captured by assuming that in German, NPs bearing oblique Case have an extra structural layer Kase phrase (KP) which is missing in NPs bearing structural Case. Focusing on dative NPs, we will show that the postulation of such a phrase-structural difference between, oblique and structural case allows for a unified explanation of a wide array of facts both from the domain of grammar and from the domain of language comprehension. First, with regard to grammar, several asymmetries between dative NPs and nominative/accusative NPs follow if the former but not the latter are included within a KP-shell, including asymmetries with respect to function changing operations, clausal licensing, binding and topic drop, among others. Corroborating evidence for our analysis of dative Case in German will be provided by a comparison with data from English and Dutch. Second, when combined with certain independent assumptions about the human sentence parsing mechanism, the postulation of a KP for datives helps explain several recent experimental findings with respect to on-line sentence understanding, including the facts that dative case is dispreferred in situations of local syntactic ambiguity and that dative case may erroneously override structural case during sentence comprehension but not vice versa. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The present experiments assessed the extent to which individual participants nevertheless adopt consistent strategies in these Bayesian reasoning problems, and investigated the nature of these strategies. In two experiments, one laboratory-based and one internet-based, each participant completed 36 problems with factorially manipulated probabilities. Many participants applied consistent strategies involving use of only one of the three probabilities provided in the problem, or additive combination of two of the probabilities. There was, however, substantial variability across participants in which probabilities were taken into account. In the laboratory experiment, participants' eye movements were tracked as they read the problems. There was evidence of a relationship between information use and attention to a source of information. Participants' self-assessments of their performance, however, revealed little confidence that the strategies they applied were actually correct. These results suggest that the hypothesis of base rate neglect actually underestimates people's difficulty with Bayesian reasoning, but also suggest that participants are aware of their ignorance.},

The studies under discussion, examined the failure to license a negative polarity item (NPI) in German: Saddy et al. (2004a) reported an N400 component when the NPI was not accurately licensed by negation; Drenhaus et al., 2004 and Drenhaus et al., to appear considered additionally the influence of constituency of the licensor in NPI constructions. A biphasic N400-P600 response was found for the two induced violations (the lack of licensor and the inaccessibility of negation in a relative clause). The symbolic resonance analysis (SRA) revealed an effect in the P600 time window for the data in Saddy et al., which was not found by using the averaging technique. The SRA of the ERPs in Drenhaus et al., showed that the P600 components are distinguishable concerning the amplitude and latency. It was smaller and earlier in the condition where the licensor is inaccessible, compared to the condition without negation in the string. Our findings suggest that the failure in licensing NPIs is not exclusively related to semantic integration costs (N400). The elicited P600 components reflect differences in syntactic processing. Our results confirm and replicate the effects of the traditional voltage average analysis and show that the SRA is a useful tool to reveal and pull apart ERP differences which are not evident using the traditional voltage average analysis.},

abstract = {In layer 4 of cat visual cortex, the monocular, concentric receptive
fields of thalamic neurons, which relay retinal input to the cortex,
are transformed into 'simple' cortical receptive fields that are
binocular and selective for the precise orientation, direction of
motion, and size of the visual stimulus. These properties are thought
to arise from the pattern of connections from thalamic neurons, although
anatomical studies show that most excitatory inputs to layer 4 simple
cells are from recurrently connected circuits of cortical neurons.
We examined single fibre inputs to spiny stellate neurons. We examined
single fibre inputs to spiny stellate neurons in slices of cat visual
cortex, and conclude that thalamocortical synapses are powerful and
the responses they evoke are unusually invariant for central synapses.
However, the responses to intracortical inputs, although less invariant,
are strong enough to provide most of the excitation to simple cells
in vivo. Our results suggest that the recurrent excitatory circuits
of cortex may amplify the initial feedforward thalamic signal, subserving
dynamic modifications of the functional properties of cortical neurons.},

abstract = {This paper examines how semantic knowledge is used in language comprehension and in making judgments about events in the world. We contrast knowledge gleaned from prior language experience ("language knowledge") and knowledge coming from prior experience with the world ("world knowledge"). In two corpus analyses, we show that previous research linking verb aspect and event representations have confounded language and world knowledge. Then, using carefully chosen stimuli that remove this confound, we performed four experiments that manipulated the degree to which language knowledge or world knowledge should be salient and relevant to performing a task, finding in each case that participants use the type of knowledge most appropriate to the task. These results provide evidence for a highly context-sensitive and interactionist perspective on how semantic knowledge is represented and used during language processing.},

@article{Schotter2014a,
abstract = {Recent Web apps have spurred excitement around the prospect of achieving speed reading by eliminating eye movements (i.e., with rapid serial visual presentation, or RSVP, in which words are presented briefly one at a time and sequentially). Our experiment using a novel trailing-mask paradigm contradicts these claims. Subjects read normally or while the display of text was manipulated such that each word was masked once the reader's eyes moved past it. This manipulation created a scenario similar to RSVP: The reader could read each word only once; regressions (i.e., rereadings of words), which are a natural part of the reading process, were functionally eliminated. Crucially, the inability to regress affected comprehension negatively. Furthermore, this effect was not confined to ambiguous sentences. These data suggest that regressions contribute to the ability to understand what one has read and call into question the viability of speed-reading apps that eliminate eye movements (e.g., those that use RSVP).},

@article{Kizach2013,
abstract = {Natural language processing is a fast and automatized process. A crucial part of this process is parsing, the online incremental construction of a syntactic structure. The aim of this study was to test whether a wh-filler extracted from an embedded clause is initially attached as the object of the matrix verb with subsequent reanalysis, and if so, whether the plausibility of such an attachment has an effect on reaction time. Finally, we wanted to examine whether subcategorization plays a role. We used a method called G-Maze to measure response time in a self-paced reading design. The experiments confirmed that there is early attachment of fillers to the matrix verb. When this attachment is implausible, the off-line acceptability of the whole sentence is significantly reduced. The on-line results showed that G-Maze was highly suited for this type of experiment. In accordance with our predictions, the results suggest that the parser ignores (or has no access to information about) implausibility and attaches fillers as soon as possible to the matrix verb. However, the results also show that the parser uses the subcategorization frame of the matrix verb. In short, the parser ignores semantic information and allows implausible attachments but adheres to information about which type of object a verb can take, ensuring that the parser does not make impossible attachments. We argue that the evidence supports a syntactic parser informed by syntactic cues, rather than one guided by semantic cues or one that is blind, or completely autonomous.},

In further analyses we investigated two common observations in visual search-the effects of display size and of variations in search efficiency across different task conditions-following a design that had been used in previous studies (Palmer, Horowitz, Torralba, {\&} Wolfe, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 37, 58-71, 2011; Wolfe, Palmer, {\&} Horowitz, Vision Research, 50, 1304-1311, 2010) in which parameters of the response distributions were measured. Our study showed that the distributional parameters in an experimental condition can be reliably estimated by moderate sample sizes when Monte Carlo simulation techniques are applied. More importantly, by analyzing trial RTs, we were able to extract paradigm-dependent shape changes in the RT distributions that could be accounted for by using the EZ2 diffusion model. The study showed that Bayesian-based RT distribution analyses can provide an important means to investigate the underlying cognitive processes in search, including stimulus grouping and the bottom-up guidance of attention.},

abstract = {Much is known about the anatomy of corticocortical connections, yet
little is known concerning their physiology. In order to have access
to the synaptic and temporal aspects of the activity elicited through
corticocortical connections, we developed an in vitro approach on
slices of rat visual cortex. We used extracellular recordings of
field potentials combined with electrical stimulation to localise
regions of areas 17 and 18a that are connected. We found that corticocortical
connections between areas 17 and 18a can be preserved in 500 microm
thick slices, with a focus of activity separated from the stimulating
electrode by 1.5 mm to more than 3 mm. The potentials elicited in
one area after stimulation of its neighbour displayed fast events,
corresponding to action potentials, and slow events, corresponding
to synaptic potentials. Intracellular recordings showed that the
earliest synaptic responses consisted of monosynaptic excitatory
potentials. Measurement of response latency showed that axons involved
in both feedforward and feedback corticocortical connections are
slowly conducting (0.3-0.8 m/s). Conduction velocity for antidromically
activated cells was not significantly different for the two sets
of connections. In an attempt to establish the spatial organisation
of functional synaptic inputs, field potential recordings were performed
in the different cortical layers and used to establish current source
density (CSD) graphs along the depth axis. The CSD maps obtained
were found to be somewhat variable from one case to another. It is
suggested that this variability results from the use of electrical
stimulation, which activates axons that are both afferent and efferent
to a given cortical area. The field potentials are therefore likely
to contain responses that correspond to the activity mediated by
the intrinsic collaterals mixed in variable amount with responses
produced by corticocortical synapses. With this restriction in mind,
it is suggested that, after stimulation of the supragranular layers,
the functional synaptic inputs of feedforward connections are concentrated
in layer 4 and the bottom of layer 3, while those of feedback axons
involve mainly the upper part of the supragranular layers. The intrinsic
collaterals of the neurones participating in corticocortical connections
seem also to provide the bulk of their inputs to the upper part of
the supragranular layers. The laminar pattern of activity obtained
after infragranular layer stimulation was comparable to that obtained
after supragranular layer stimulation, except for the addition of
a supplementary region of activated synapses in the infragranular
layers.},

abstract = {1. Ecologists use statistical models for both explanation and prediction, and need techniques that are flexible enough to express typical features of their data, such as nonlinearities and interactions. 2. This study provides a working guide to boosted regression trees (BRT), an ensemble method for fitting statistical models that differs fundamentally from conventional techniques that aim to fit a single parsimonious model. Boosted regression trees combine the strengths of two algorithms: regression trees (models that relate a response to their predictors by recursive binary splits) and boosting (an adaptive method for combining many simple models to give improved predictive performance). The final BRT model can be understood as an additive regression model in which individual terms are simple trees, fitted in a forward, stagewise fashion. 3. Boosted regression trees incorporate important advantages of tree-based methods, handling different types of predictor variables and accommodating missing data. They have no need for prior data transformation or elimination of outliers, can fit complex nonlinear relationships, and automatically handle interaction effects between predictors. Fitting multiple trees in BRT overcomes the biggest drawback of single tree models: their relatively poor predictive performance. Although BRT models are complex, they can be summarized in ways that give powerful ecological insight, and their predictive performance is superior to most traditional modelling methods. 4. The unique features of BRT raise a number of practical issues in model fitting. We demonstrate the practicalities and advantages of using BRT through a distributional analysis of the short-finned eel (Anguilla australis Richardson), a native freshwater fish of New Zealand. We use a data set of over 13 000 sites to illustrate effects of several settings, and then fit and interpret a model using a subset of the data. We provide code and a tutorial to enable the wider use of BRT by ecologists.},

The research reported in this article demonstrates discrete processing of information in an anagram task selected because of its similarity to insight problems, which seem subjectively to produce discrete "illumination" during processing. The authors used speed-accuracy decomposition (SAD), a relatively new technique for investigating the time course of information processing. The results of 2 experiments indicate little or no partial information in the anagram tasks, in contrast to previous research with SAD, all of which has revealed partial information.

@article{Lau2016,
abstract = {The question of whether humans represent grammatical knowledge as a binary condition on membership in a set of wellformed sentences, or as a probabilistic property has been the subject of debate among linguists, psychologists, and cognitive scientists for many decades. Acceptability judgments present a serious problem for both classical binary and probabilistic theories of grammaticality. These judgements are gradient in nature, and so cannot be directly accommodated in a binary formal grammar. However, it is also not possible to simply reduce acceptability to probability. The acceptability of a sentence is not the same as the likelihood of its occurrence, which is, in part, determined by factors like sentence length and lexical frequency. In this paper, we present the results of a set of largescale experiments using crowdsourced acceptability judgments that demonstrate gradience to be a pervasive feature in acceptability judgments. We then show how one can predict acceptability judgments on the basis of probability by augmenting probabilistic language models with an acceptability measure. This is a function that normalizes probability values to eliminate the confounding factors of length and lexical frequency. We describe a sequence of modeling experiments with unsupervised language models drawn from stateoftheart machine learning methods in natural language processing. Several of these models achieve very encouraging levels of accuracy in the acceptability prediction task, as measured by the correlation between the acceptability measure scores and mean human acceptability values. We consider the relevance of these results to the debate on the nature of grammatical competence, and we argue that they support the view that linguistic knowledge can be intrinsically probabilistic.},

We propose a general method that allows for the inclusion of response times (RTs) into any kind of MPT model to measure the relative speed of the hypothesized processes. The approach relies on the fundamental assumption that observed RT distributions emerge as mixtures of latent RT distributions that correspond to different underlying processing paths. To avoid auxiliary assumptions about the shape of these latent RT distributions, we account for RTs in a distribution-free way by splitting each observed category into several bins from fast to slow responses, separately for each individual. Given these data, latent RT distributions are parameterized by probability parameters for these RT bins, and an extended MPT model is obtained. Hence, all of the statistical results and software available for MPT models can easily be used to fit, test, and compare RT-extended MPT models. We demonstrate the proposed method by applying it to the two-high-threshold model of recognition memory.},

abstract = {In English, words like scissors are grammatically plural but conceptually singular, while words like suds are both grammatically and conceptually plural. Words like army can be construed plurally, despite being grammatically singular. To explore whether and how congruence between grammatical and conceptual number affected the production of subject-verb number agreement in English, we elicited sentence completions for complex subject noun phrases like The advertisement for the scissors. In these phrases, singular subject nouns were followed by distractor words whose grammatical and conceptual numbers varied. The incidence of plural attraction (the use of plural verbs after plural distractors) increased only when distractors were grammatically plural, and revealed no influence from the distractors' number meanings. Companion experiments in Dutch offered converging support for this account and suggested that similar agreement processes operate in that language. The findings argue for a component of agreement that is sensitive primarily to the grammatical reflections of number. Together with other results, the evidence indicates that the implementation of agreement in languages like English and Dutch involves separable processes of number marking and number morphing, in which number meaning plays different parts. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {The goal of the present study was to test the predictions of two contrasting claims about the role of morphology in subject―verb number agreement production. According to the maximalist view described by Vigliocco, Hartsuiker, Jarema, and Kolk, languages with relatively rich inflectional morphology may be more susceptible to the influence of notional number due to the penetration of meaning into the agreement process. An alternative proposed by Eberhard, Cutting, and Bock predicts the opposite: Languages with richer inflectional morphology are less susceptible to notional number because inflectional morphemes filter the effect of number meaning. In the present experiments, utterances differing in notional number properties were elicited from speakers of two varieties of Spanish that vary in morphological richness. In Experiment 1, participants formed sentences with overt subjects. In Experiment 2, they produced sentences with null subjects. Results supported the hypothesis that richer morphology reduces notional effects during agreement production, both within and across languages. (English)},

However, these tests may not have permitted optimal attentional focusing. In 4 experiments subjects identified an attentionally cued target letter embedded among distractors. Only minimal effects of information appearing in to-be-ignored locations were observed. This striking efficiency of selection provides support for early selection theories and calls into question some late selection theories holding that stimuli throughout the display are immediately and fully identified prior to attentional selection. In order to explain the larger pattern of results across a variety of focused- and divided-attention paradigms, a hybrid model is advanced with a flexible locus for visual selection.},

Some of these models are expressed with a closed-form equation (e.g. the Weibull distribution). However, a large number of others are not available in closed form, including convolutions. Fitting such distributions with the likelihood method is still possible with the help of numerical integration techniques. However, the time required to fit a single subject is a matter of days. We present an alternative to numerical integration based on rational approximations. This approach is 100 times faster so that fitting a single subject can be done in less than an hour. As shown with simulations, the approach can be fully automatized, and is both reliable and accurate. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (chapter)},

Given RT samples, one can decide which of these three operation is the true decomposition rule by choosing the operation producing the smallest Smirnov distance between the RT samples combined in a certain way, as described by E. N. Dzhafarov and J. M. Cortese (1996, Journal of Mathematical Psychology 40, 185-202). By means of Monte- Carlo simulations, we determine at what sample sizes this decision identifies the true decomposition rule reliably. The results indicate that for a broad class of RT distribution functions the sample sizes required are by an order of magnitude larger when the component times are stochastically independent than when they are perfectly positively stochastically interdependent. In both cases, however, the required sample sizes are realistically achievable in an experiment, provided the experimental factors selectively influencing component times are sufficiently effective. Addition and maximum are generally more difficult to discriminate than addition and minimum, which in turn are more difficult to discriminate than maximum and minimum.},

Previous research had shown two ERP components to correlate with phrase structure violations: an early left anterior negativity (ELAN), which is assumed to reflect first-pass parsing processes, and a late parietally distributed positivity (P600), assumed to reflect second-pass parsing processes. We hypothesized that the first-pass parsing processes are highly automatic, whereas second-pass parsing processes are more controlled. To test this hypothesis we varied the proportion of correct sentences and sentences containing phrase structure violations with incorrect sentences being either of a low (20{\%} violation) or a high (80{\%} violation) proportion. Results showed that the early left anterior negativity was elicited and equally pronounced under both proportion conditions. By contrast, the late positivity was elicited for a low proportion of incorrect sentences only. This data pattern suggests that first-pass parsing processes are automatic, whereas second-pass parsing processes are under participants' strategic control.},

Here, we investigate these effects in the context of sentence processing: targets for retrieval during online sentence processing of English object relative clause constructions differ in the amount of elaboration associated with the target noun phrase, or the homogeneity of superficial features (text color). Experiment 1 shows that greater elaboration for targets during the encoding phase reduces reading times at retrieval sites, but elaboration of non-targets has considerably weaker effects. Experiment 2 illustrates that processing isolated superficial features of target noun phrases-here, a green word in a sentence with words colored white-does not lead to enhanced memory performance, despite triggering longer encoding times. These results are interpreted in the light of the memory models of Nairne, 1990, 2001, 2006, which state that encoding remnants contribute to the set of retrieval cues that provide the basis for similarity-based interference effects.},

In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

We find that no finite-state Markov process that produces symbols with transition from state to state can serve as an English grammar. Furthermore, the particular subclass of such processes that produce{\textless}tex{\textgreater}n{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}-order statistical approximations to English do not come closer, with increasing{\textless}tex{\textgreater}n{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}, to matching the output of an English grammar. We formalize-the notions of "phrase structure" and show that this gives us a method for describing language which is essentially more powerful, though still representable as a rather elementary type of finite-state process. Nevertheless, it is successful only when limited to a small subset of simple sentences. We study the formal properties of a set of grammatical transformations that carry sentences with phrase structure into new sentences with derived phrase structure, showing that transformational grammars are processes of the same elementary type as phrase-structure grammars; that the grammar of English is materially simplified if phrase structure description is limited to a kernel of simple sentences from which all other sentences are constructed by repeated transformations; and that this view of linguistic structure gives a certain insight into the use and understanding of language.},

abstract = {Filler-gap dependencies make strong demands on working memory in language comprehension because they cannot always be immediately resolved. In a series of three reading-time studies, we test the idea that these demands can be decomposed into active maintenance processes and retrieval events. Results indicate that the fact that a displaced phrase exists and the identity of its basic syntactic category both immediately impact comprehension at potential gap sites. In contrast, specific lexical details of the displaced phrase show an immediate effect only for short dependencies and a much later effect for longer dependencies. We argue that coarse-grained information about the filler is actively maintained and is used to make phrase structure parsing decisions, whereas finer grained information is more quickly released from active maintenance and consequently has to be retrieved at the gap site.},

abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that hierarchical phrase structures are instrumental in describing human language, their role in cognitive processing is still debated. We investigated the role of hierarchical structure in sentence processing by implementing a range of probabilistic language models, some of which depended on hierarchical structure, and others of which relied on sequential structure only. All models estimated the occurrence probabilities of syntactic categories in sentences for which reading-time data were available. Relating the models' probability estimates to the data showed that the hierarchical-structure models did not account for variance in reading times over and above the amount of variance accounted for by all of the sequential-structure models. This suggests that a sentence's hierarchical structure, unlike many other sources of information, does not noticeably affect the generation of expectations about upcoming words.},

time was used to index attentional allocation to word, textbase,

to this level of representation on the second reading, suggesting
that mature readers may give greater priority to situation model
construction when first encountering text. Also, for both genres,
older adults showed relatively less facilitation than the young in
word-level processing in rereading, suggesting that representation
at this level is not as firmly established during reading or decays
more quickly for older readers. For narrative texts only, this pattern
also obtained for textbase processing. Collectively, these data show
that age equivalence in text comprehension at the molar level may
be accomplished through different processing routes at the molecular

These results contrast with results from processing other Subject-Verb-Object languages like English, in which object-extracted structures are more complex than subject-extracted structures. A key word-order difference between Chinese and other Subject-Verb-Object languages is that Chinese relative clauses precede their head nouns. Because of this word order difference, the results follow from a resource-based theory of sentence complexity, according to which there is a storage cost associated with predicting syntactic heads in order to form a grammatical sentence. The results are also consistent with a theory according to which people have less difficulty processing embedded clauses whose word order matches the word order in main clauses. Some corpus analyses of Chinese texts provide results that constrain the classes of possible frequency-based theories. Critically, these results demonstrate that there is nothing intrinsically easy about extracting from subject position: depending on the word order in the main clause and in a relative clause, extraction from object position can be easier to process in some circumstances.},

Experiment 1 employed sentences like Thats the garage/pistol with which the heartless killer shot the man yesterday afternoon. Readers experienced greater processing difficulty in implausible sen- tences than in plausible sentences immediately after encountering the verb shot. This demonstrated that they did not wait until the purported gap location after man before forming the unbounded dependency. Experiment 2 considered sentences which locally appear to have an unbounded depen- dency that turns out to be incorrect. Data from this experiment demonstrated that readers formed the unbounded dependency immediately, even though they had to reanalyze later. However, there was no evidence that readers formed this unbounded dependency when it was rendered ungrammatical by island-constraint information. We argue that the processor constructs unbounded dependencies in a manner that is maximally efficient from the point of view of incremental processing.},

In five experiments, the hypothesis that multiple non-referents would produce a cumulative interference effect (i.e., a fan effect) was examined. This hypothesis was supported in Experiments 1A and 1B, with subjects being less accurate and slower to recognize referents (1A) and non-referents (1B) as the number of potential referents increased from two to five. Surprisingly, the number of potential referents led to a decrease in anaphor reading times. The results of Experiments 2A and 2B replicated the probe-recognition results in a completely within-subjects design and ruled out the possibility that a speeded-reading strategy led to the fan-effect findings. The results of Experiment 3 provided evidence that subjects were resolving the anaphors. These results suggest that multiple non-referents do produce a cumulative interference effect; however, additional research is necessary to explore the effect on anaphor reading times.},

Participants were asked to name pictures in Mandarin while visual distractor words were presented before, at, or after picture onset (i.e., stimulus-onset asynchrony/SOA = −100, 0, or +100 ms, respectively). Compared with the unrelated control, the distractors sharing atonal syllables with the picture names significantly facilitated the naming responses at −100- and 0-ms SOAs. In addition, the facilitation effect of sharing word-initial segments only appeared at 0-ms SOA, and null effects were found for sharing word-final segments. These results indicate that both syllables and subsyllabic units play important roles in Mandarin spoken word production and more critically that syllabic processing precedes subsyllabic processing. The current results lend strong support to the proximate units principle (O'Seaghdha, Chen, {\&} Chen, 2010), which holds that the phonological structure of spoken word production is language-specific and that atonal syllables are the proximate phonological units in Mandarin Chinese. On the other hand, the significance of word-initial segments over word-final segments suggests that serial processing of segmental information seems to be universal across Germanic languages and Chinese, which remains to be verified in future studies.},

Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species.

abstract = {Tel: +886-6-571-5131 {\#}62027 2 Abstract This study reports three sets of experiments that investigate the impact of context on structure generation in on-line sentence processing. Unlike previous studies that have addressed the role of context in resolving ambiguities, the current study examined the role of context in helping the parser to identify unambiguous structures that it could not otherwise recognize. The first set of experiments shows that late disambiguation of Chinese head-final relative clauses (RCs) elicits mild garden-path effects, and that a direct cue from the particle suo can facilitate the processing of head-final RCs. The second set of experiments shows that, in contrast to the direct cue, the parser fails to use an indirect-but-unambiguous cue from a mismatching classifier-noun sequence to recognize an upcoming RC structure and to avoid a garden path at the end of the RC. The third set of experiments shows that, when a supporting context for an RC is provided, the parser becomes able to use the indirect cue of the mismatching classifier-noun sequence to recognize an upcoming relative clause. Taken together, the findings suggest that there is a limitation on the parser's ability to act upon unambiguous-yet-indirect cues in incremental structure building. When such a situation occurs, contextual information becomes crucial and it actively contributes to the structure generation process to help the parser to recognize incoming structures. These findings suggest that structural and non-structural information can interact with each other in the structure generation process, providing a type of evidence for interactivity in structure generation that has proven elusive in previous studies. 3 Introduction},

Through comprehensive, integrative genomic analysis of all available human disease characterizations we gain crucial insight into the molecular phenomena underlying pathogenesis as well as intra- and inter-disease differentiation. Such knowledge is crucial in the development of improved clinical diagnostics and the identification of molecular targets for novel therapeutics. In this study we build on our previous work to realize the next important step in large-scale translational discovery and analysis, which is to automatically identify those genomic experiments in which a disease state is compared to a normal control state. We present an automated text mining method that employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically identify disease-related experiments in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) that include measurements for both disease and normal control states. In this manner, we find that 62{\%} of disease-related experiments contain sample subsets that can be automatically identified as normal controls. Furthermore, we calculate that the identified experiments characterize diseases that contribute to 30{\%} of all human disease-related mortality in the United States. This work demonstrates that we now have the necessary tools and methods to initiate large-scale translational bioinformatics inquiry across the broad spectrum of high-impact human disease.},

abstract = {It is well-known that word frequency and predictability affect processing time. These effects change magnitude across tasks, but studies testing this use tasks with different response types (e.g., lexical decision, naming, and fixation time during reading; Schilling, Rayner, {\&} Chumbley, 1998), preventing direct comparison. Recently, Kaakinen and Hy??n?? (2010) overcame this problem, comparing fixation times in reading for comprehension and proofreading, showing that the frequency effect was larger in proofreading than in reading. This result could be explained by readers exhibiting substantial cognitive flexibility, and qualitatively changing how they process words in the proofreading task in a way that magnifies effects of word frequency. Alternatively, readers may not change word processing so dramatically, and instead may perform more careful identification generally, increasing the magnitude of many word processing effects (e.g., both frequency and predictability). We tested these possibilities with two experiments: subjects read for comprehension and then proofread for spelling errors (letter transpositions) that produce nonwords (e.g., trcak for track as in Kaakinen {\&} Hy??n??) or that produce real but unintended words (e.g., trial for trail) to compare how the task changes these effects. Replicating Kaakinen and Hy??n??, frequency effects increased during proofreading. However, predictability effects only increased when integration with the sentence context was necessary to detect errors (i.e., when spelling errors produced words that were inappropriate in the sentence; trial for trail). The results suggest that readers adopt sophisticated word processing strategies to accommodate task demands. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Evidence from recent experiments that monitored attention in clipart scenes during spoken com- prehension suggests that people preferably rely on non-stereotypical depicted events over stereotypical thematic knowledge for incremental interpretation. The Coordinated Interplay Account (Knoeferle Crocker, 2006) accounts for this preference through referential processing (e.g., the verb mediates a depicted event) and the preferred use of scene event information that is associated with the referent (e.g., the agent of the depicted event). Three eye-tracking experiments examined the generality of this account. While the rapid use of depicted events was replicated in all three studies, the preference to rely on them was modulated by the decay of events that were no longer co-present. Our findings motivate the extension of the Coordinated Interplay Account with an ex- plicit working memory. The coordinated interplay mechanism together with working memory and decay, is shown to account for the influence of scene-derived versus stored knowledge both when events are co-present and when they have recently been perceived.

abstract = {An eye-movement-monitoring experiment tested readers' responses to sentences containing relative clauses that could be attached to one or both of two preceding nouns. Previous experiments with such sentences have indicated that globally ambiguous relative clauses are processed more quickly than are determinately attached relative clauses. Central to the present research, a recent study (Swets, Desmet, Hambrick, {\&} Ferreira, 2007) showed that offline preferences for such sentences differ as a function of working memory capacity. Specifically, both English and Dutch participants' preference for the second of two nouns as the host for the relative clause increased as their working memory capacity increased. In the present study, readers' working memory capacity was measured, and eye movements were monitored. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to determine whether working memory capacity moderated readers' online processing performance. The modeling indicated that determinately attached sentences were harder to process than globally ambiguous sentences, that working memory did not affect processing of the relative clause itself, but that working memory did moderate how easy it was to integrate the relative clause with the preceding sentence context. Specifically, in contrast with the offline results from Swets and colleagues' study, readers with higher working memory capacity were more likely to prefer the first noun over the second noun as the host for the relative clause.},

abstract = {An ideal experiment is one in which data collection is efficient and the results are maximally informative. This standard can be difficult to achieve because of uncertainties about the consequences of design decisions. We demonstrate the success of a Bayesian adaptive method (adaptive design optimization, ADO) in optimizing design decisions when comparing models of the time course of forgetting. Across a series of testing stages, ADO intelligently adapts the retention interval in order to maximally discriminate power and exponential models. Compared with two different control (non-adaptive) methods, ADO distinguishes the models decisively, with the results unambiguously favoring the power model. Analyses suggest that ADO's success is due in part to its flexibility in adjusting to individual differences. This implementation of ADO serves as an important first step in assessing its applicability and usefulness to psychology.},

Such a parallel matching procedure could in principle ignore the serial order or hierarchical structure characteristic of linguistic relations. I present an eye tracking while reading experiment that investigates whether the sentential position of a potential antecedent modulates the strength of similarity-based interference, a well-studied effect in which increased similarity in features between a target and its competitors results in slower and less accurate retrieval overall. The manipulation trades on an independently established Locality bias in sluiced structures to associate a wh-remnant (which ones) in clausal ellipsis with the most local correlate (some wines), as in The tourists enjoyed some wines, but I don't know which ones. The findings generally support cue-based parsing models of sentence processing that are subject to similarity-based interference in retrieval, and provide additional support to the growing body of evidence that retrieval is sensitive to both the structural position of a target antecedent and its competitors, and the specificity or diagnosticity of retrieval cues.},

abstract = {Many evaluations of cognitive models rely on data that have been averaged or aggregated across all experimental subjects, and so fail to consider the possibility of important individual differences between subjects. Other evaluations are done at the single-subject level, and so fail to benefit from the reduction of noise that data averaging or aggregation potentially provides. To overcome these weaknesses, we have developed a general approach to modeling individual differences using families of cognitive models in which different groups of subjects are identified as having different psychological behavior. Separate models with separate parameterizations are applied to each group of subjects, and Bayesian model selection is used to determine the appropriate number of groups. We evaluate this individual differences approach in a simulation study and show that it is superior in terms of the key modeling goals of prediction and understanding. We also provide two practical demonstrations of the approach, one using the ALCOVE model of category learning with data from four previously analyzed category learning experiments, the other using multidimensional scaling representational models with previously analyzed similarity data for colors. In both demonstrations, meaningful individual differences are found and the psychological models are able to account for this variation through interpretable differences in parameterization. The results highlight the potential of extending cognitive models to consider individual differences.},

We present an eye-tracking experiment that investigates number attraction during recovery from garden-path sentences. The sentences contrasted locally ambiguous with unambiguous structures containing a plural or a singular attractor noun before a singular verb. Reading time data from the experiment suggest that number attraction effects occur when the processor has difficulty finding a grammatical analysis: Sentences with a local ambiguity had longer regression-path times when there was a plural number attractor than when there was a singular number attractor. The attractor number did not affect the processing of the unambiguous sentences.},

@article{ODonnell2005,
abstract = {Understanding developmental and evolutionary aspects of the language faculty requires comparing adult languages users' abilities with those of non-verbal subjects, such as babies and non-human animals. Classically, comparative work in this area has relied on the rich theoretical frameworks developed by linguists in the generative grammar tradition. However, the great variety of generative theories and the fact that they are models of language specifically makes it difficult to know what to test in animals and children lacking the expressive abilities of normal, mature adults. We suggest that this problem can be mitigated by tapping equally rich, but more formal mathematical approaches to language. Modern linguistics is dominated by an approach known as the generative paradigm. Generative theory is built around several core ideas about the nature of language and its study. One important cornerstone of the approach since its inception has been the way in which it envisions building theories of human language. Under the genera-tive framework, researchers construct clear, precise models, called grammars, to describe the mature speaker's knowledge and use of language. These models are often constructed using tools from logic, mathematics and the theory of computation. The advantage of constructing such precise, and often mathematically formalized models is that the consequences of modeling decisions can be deduced directly from assumptions [1]. One of the most important questions for generative linguists and other language scientists is what biological features endow our species with its linguistic ability. Often this is expressed as the problem of determining the innate resources the child has for acquiring language [2]. It can also be reframed as an evolutionary question: Do we share some, all, or none of the key components of the language faculty with other species, and in cases where we are uniquely endowed as a species, did these capacities evolve for language in particular or for multiple domains of cognition [3,4]? Clearly such questions about language development and evolution require comparing normal adult human language abilities with the corresponding (if any) abilities in non-verbal subjects such as babies and animals. However, there are several challenges for the compara-tive experimentalist interested in turning generative theories into testable empirical predictions. First, there are a great number of generative theories of language to choose from (e.g. just in the realm of syntactic theory [5–9]). To varying degrees these theories have their own nota-tions, their own terminology, and their own analogies with other mathematical and scientific theories. Moreover, because these theories characterize brain computations and systems of knowledge at a very high level of abstraction it is often the case that theories with radically different appearances can 'do the same work' in not-so-obvious ways (e.g. see [10]) The choice of which com-ponents of which theories to explore in non-verbal subjects is far from trivial. Second, generative theories are built to account for the knowledge and use of normal human adult language. As such it is not always clear what they have to say about the abilities of pre-or non-linguistic subjects, such as human infants and non-human animals. It is therefore important to isolate aspects of generative theories that can be plausibly expected to show up in the non-verbal abilities of test subjects. The subfield of mathematical linguistics offers a number of tools that allow abstract theories of language and mental computation to be compared and contrasted with one another (e.g. see [11]). We suggest that formu-lating comparative hypotheses with enough precision to make use of these tools can reduce some of the difficulties mentioned above. We use one set of tools from mathe-matical linguistics, formal language theory, to illustrate the potential power of mathematical approaches, sketch-ing its basic concepts and discussing how they were used in one empirical example from the animal literature. We fully acknowledge that this is an area with varied opinion concerning the merits of different mathematical approaches, and the theories that back them. Brevity, however, forces us to be selective, focusing on a small corner of this potentially broad research space.},

In two experiments (visual versus auditory presentation) using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we addressed this question by presenting sentences in which the critical word simultaneously realized both a word category and a transitivity violation. ERPs for sentences with both types of violation clustered with the patterns for sentences with a word category violation only, but were different from the patterns elicited by argument structure violations in isolation, since only the latter elicited an N400 ERP component. The finding that an argument structure violation evoked an N400 only if the phrase structure of the respective sentence was correct suggests that a successful integration of the word category information of a verb functionally precedes the application of its argument structure information.},

abstract = {This article is broadly concerned with the differences between individual language learners. In terms of particular content areas of Individual Differences (ID) research, it surveys developments in foreign language aptitude, motivation, learner strategies, and learner styles. A brief review of earlier research on aptitude is presented, followed by discussions of more contemporary work on the origin of aptitude, namely, as a residue of first language learning ability, and on the existence of evidence for learner types. Motivation research is reviewed partly with regard to Robert Gardner's research, and then in terms of a wider framework for the functioning of motivation within an educational context. The review of learner strategies research emphasizes current attempts to develop taxonomies of such strategies, and to investigate their theoretical basis and their trainability. Finally, learner styles research, drawing on field independence theory, is discussed, and links are made with the research on aptitude. The article finishes with sections on conceptual and methodological issues in ID research.},

abstract = {Do the grammars of English and German contain a ban on moving the lower of two wh-phrases (Superiority), or is the lower acceptability due simply to the complexity of processing the longer dependency that results when the lower wh-phrase is moved? The results of four acceptability-judgment studies suggest that a pure processing account is inadequate. Crossing wh-dependencies lower the acceptability of both German and English questions but with a significantly larger penalty in English than in German (experiment 1). The larger penalty in English cannot be attributed to greater sensitivity to violations in English, because relative clause island violations result in similar effects in the two languages (experiment 2). A pure processing account might claim long dependencies are easier to process in German than in English because of richer case, but a control experiment did not support this possibility (experiment 4). We suggest that moving the lower of two wh-phrases is banned in the grammar of English but not in the grammar of German. This predicts that there should be a penalty for crossing dependencies in English even in helpful (Bolinger) contexts, as confirmed in experiment 3, and even in short easy-to-process sentences, as confirmed by simple six-word sentences in Clifton, Fanselow {\&} Frazier 2006. Finally, if German grammar does not contain a ban on crossing, it is not surprising that the penalty in German is smaller than in English or that like animacy of the two wh-phrases plays a larger role in German than in English because feature similarity generally gives rise to difficulty in processing, whereas in English a grammatical ban on crossing will reduce acceptability regardless of whether there is processing difficulty.},

The present paper argues that the distinction between perception$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand decision-making is unnecessary, and that it is possible to give a unified account of both lexical processing and decision making. This claim is supported by formal$\backslash$r$\backslash$narguments, and reinforced by simulations showing how the Bayesian Reader model$\backslash$r$\backslash$n(Norris, 2006) can be extended to fit the data on RT distributions collected by Ratcliff, Gomez and McKoon, simply by adding extra sources of noise. The Bayesian Reader gives an integrated explanation of both word recognition and decision making, using fewer parameters than the diffusion model. It can be thought of as a Bayesian diffusion model, which subsumes Ratcliff's drift-diffusion model as a special case.},

abstract = {An eye-tracking experiment examined whether prosodic cues can affect the interpretation of grammatical functions in the absence of clear morphological information. German listeners were presented with scenes depicting three potential referents while hearing temporarily ambiguous SVO and OVS sentences. While case marking on the first noun phrase (NP) was ambiguous, clear case marking on the second NP disambiguated sentences towards SVO or OVS. Listeners interpreted case-ambiguous NP1s more often as Subject, and thus expected an Object as upcoming argument, only when sentence beginnings carried an SVO-type intonation. This was revealed by more anticipatory eye movements to suitable Patients (Objects) than Agents (Subjects) in the visual scenes. No such preference was found when sentence beginnings had an OVS-type intonation. Prosodic cues were integrated rapidly enough to affect listeners' interpretation of grammatical function before disambiguating case information was available. We conclude that in addition to manipulating attachment ambiguities, prosody can influence the interpretation of constituent order ambiguities.},

Spellman, 1995; A. R. A. Conway {\&} R. W. Engle, 1994). It was found that the Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) theory, which embodies associative interference, is consistent with the results of G. A. Radvansky et al. and that there is no evidence for concept suppression in a new fan experiment. The ACT-R model provides good quantitative fits to the results, as shown in a variety of experiments. The 3 key concepts in these fits are (a) the associative strength between 2 concepts reflects the degree to which one concept predicts the other; (b) foils ar rejected by retrieving mismatching facts; and (c) participants can adjust the relative weights they give to various cues in retrieval.},

abstract = {Syntactic priming during language production is pervasive and well-studied. Hearing, reading, speaking or writing a sentence with a given structure increases the probability of subsequently producing the same structure, regardless of whether the prime and target share lexical content. In contrast, syntactic priming during comprehension has proven more elusive, fueling claims that comprehension is less dependent on general syntactic representations and more dependent on lexical knowledge. In three experiments we explored syntactic priming during spoken language comprehension. Participants acted out double-object (DO) or prepositional-object (PO) dative sentences while their eye movements were recorded. Prime sentences used different verbs and nouns than the target sentences. In target sentences, the onset of the direct-object noun was consistent with both an animate recipient and an inanimate theme, creating a temporary ambiguity in the argument structure of the verb (DO e.g., Show the horse the book; PO e.g., Show the horn to the dog). We measured the difference in looks to the potential recipient and the potential theme during the ambiguous interval. In all experiments, participants who heard DO primes showed a greater preference for the recipient over the theme than those who heard PO primes, demonstrating across-verb priming during online language comprehension. These results accord with priming found in production studies, indicating a role for abstract structural information during comprehension as well as production.},

Models are not intended to capture fully the processes they attempt to elucidate. Rather, they are explorations of ideas about the nature of cognitive processes. In these explorations, simplification is essential-through simplification, the implications of the central ideas become more transparent. This is not to say that simplification has no downsides; it does, and these are discussed. I then consider several contemporary frameworks for cognitive modeling, stressing the idea that each framework is useful in its own particular ways. Increases in computer power (by a factor of about 4 million) since 1958 have enabled new modeling paradigms to emerge, but these also depend on new ways of thinking. Will new paradigms emerge again with the next 1,000-fold increase?},

However, prior studies have not clearly dissociated the effects of accurate lexical prediction from other forms of contextual facilitation such as plausibility or semantic priming. In this study, we measured electrophysiological responses to predicted and unpredicted target words in passages providing varying levels of contextual support. This method was used to isolate the neural effects of prediction from other potential contextual influences on lexical processing. While both prediction and discourse context influenced ERP amplitudes within the time range of the N400, the effects of prediction occurred much more rapidly, preceding contextual facilitation by approximately 100. ms. In addition, a frontal, post-N400 positivity (PNP) was modulated by both prediction accuracy and the overall plausibility of the preceding passage. These results suggest a unique temporal primacy for prediction in facilitating lexical access. They also suggest that the frontal PNP may index the costs of revising discourse representations following an incorrect lexical prediction.},

abstract = {We investigated the relationship between linguistic representation and memory access by comparing the processing of two linguistic dependencies that require comprehenders to check that the subject of the current clause has the correct morphological features: subject-verb agreement and reflexive anaphors in English. In two eye-tracking experiments we examined the impact of structurally illicit noun phrases on the computation of reflexive and subject-verb agreement. Experiment 1 directly compared the two dependencies within participants. Results show a clear difference in the intrusion profile associated with each dependency: agreement resolution displays clear intrusion effects in comprehension (as found by Pearlmutter, Garnsey, {\&} Bock, 1999; Wagers, Lau, {\&} Phillips, 2009), but reflexives show no such intrusion effect from illicit antecedents (Sturt, 2003; Xiang, Dillon, {\&} Phillips, 2009). Experiment 2 replicated the lack of intrusion for reflexives, confirming the reliability of the pattern and examining a wider range of feature combinations. In addition, we present modeling evidence that suggests that the reflexive results are best captured by a memory retrieval mechanism that uses primarily syntactic information to guide retrievals for the anaphor's antecedent, in contrast to the mixed morphological and syntactic cues used resolve subject-verb agreement dependencies. Despite the fact that agreement and reflexive dependencies are subject to a similar morphological agreement constraint, in online processing comprehenders appear to implement this constraint in distinct ways for the two dependencies. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

QMPE enables users to estimate parameters for the ex-Gaussian and Gumbel (1958) distributions, along with three "shifted" distributions (i.e., distributions with a parameter-dependent lower bound): the Lognormal, Wald, and Weibul distributions. Estimation can be performed using either the standard continuous maximum likelihood (CML) method or quantile maximum probability (QMP; Heathcote {\&} Brown, in press). We review the properties of each distribution and the theoretical evidence showing that CML estimates fail for some cases with shifted distributions, whereas QMP estimates do not. In cases in which CML does not fail, a Monte Carlo investigation showed that QMP estimates were usually as good, and in some cases better, than CML estimates. However, the Monte Carlo study also uncovered problems that can occur with both CML and QMP estimates, particularly when samples are small and skew is low, highlighting the difficulties of estimating distributions with parameter-dependent lower bounds.},

Eighteen individuals with severe CHI and 18 controls switched between classifying whether a digit was odd or even and whether a letter was a consonant or vowel on every 4th trial. The target stimuli appeared in a circle divided into 8 equivalent parts. Presentation of the stimuli rotated clockwise. Participants performed the switching task at both a short (200 ms) and a long (1,000 ms) preparatory interval. Although the participants with CHI exhibited slower response times and greater switch costs, similar to controls, additional preparatory time reduced the switch costs, and the switch costs were limited to the 1st trial in the run. These findings indicate that participants with severe CHI were able to take advantage of time to prepare for the task switch, and the executive control processes involved in the switch costs were completed before the 1st trial of the run ended.},

Here we illustrate this approach with two-rectangle cueing in visual attention (Egly et al., 1994). We replicated previous experimental cue-validity effects relating to a spatial shift of attention within an object (spatial effect), to attention switch between objects (object effect), and to the attraction of attention toward the display centroid (attraction effect), also taking into account the design-inherent imbalance of valid and other trials. We simultaneously estimated variance/covariance components of subject-related random effects for these spatial, object, and attraction effects in addition to their mean reaction times (RTs). The spatial effect showed a strong positive correlation with mean RT and a strong negative correlation with the attraction effect. The analysis of individual differences suggests that slow subjects engage attention more strongly at the cued location than fast subjects. We compare this joint LMM analysis of experimental effects and associated subject-related variances and correlations with two frequently used alternative statistical procedures.},

abstract = {mental representation is fundamental for human cognition. Forming such representations in time, especially from dynamic and noisy perceptual input, is a challenge for any processing modality, but perhaps none so acutely as for language processing. We show that LISA (Hummel {\&} Holyoak, 1997) and DORA (Doumas, Hummel, {\&} Sandhofer, 2008), models built to process and to learn structured (i.e., symbolic) representations of conceptual properties and relations from unstructured inputs, show oscillatory activation during processing that is highly similar to the cortical activity elicited by the linguistic stimuli from Ding et al. (2016). We argue, as Ding et al. (2016), that this activation reflects formation of hierarchical linguistic representation, and furthermore, that the kind of computational mechanisms in LISA/DORA (e.g., temporal binding by systematic asynchrony of firing) may underlie formation of abstract linguistic representations in the human brain. It may be this repurposing that allowed for the generation or emergence of hierarchical linguistic structure, and therefore, human language, from extant cognitive and neural systems. We conclude that models of thinking and reasoning and models of language processing must be integrated—not only for increased plausibility, but in order to advance both fields towards a larger integrative model of human cognition.},

However, it remains poorly understood what grammatical characteristics of natural language they implicitly learn and represent as a consequence of optimizing the language modeling objective. Here we deploy the methods of controlled psycholinguistic experimentation to shed light on to what extent RNN behavior reflects incremental syntactic state and grammatical dependency representations known to characterize human linguistic behavior. We broadly test two publicly available long short-term memory (LSTM) English sequence models, and learn and test a new Japanese LSTM. We demonstrate that these models represent and maintain incremental syntactic state, but that they do not always generalize in the same way as humans. Furthermore, none of our models learn the appropriate grammatical dependency configurations licensing reflexive pronouns or negative polarity items.},

It has also been shown that, irrespective of the time condition chosen, GJTs' grammatical sentences tap into IK, whereas their ungrammatical ones invoke EK (Guti{\'{e}}rrez, 2013). The current study examined these conclusions by employing two more fine-grained measures of IK: that is, a self-paced reading task and a word-monitoring task. The results of a confirmatory factor analysis revealed that manipulating GJTs' time conditions and/or the grammaticality of the sentences does not render them distinct measures of EK and IK. The current work shows that GJTs are too coarse to be measures of IK, and that the different types of GJTs measure different levels of EK.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Three experiments are summarized that were designed to investigate the reanalysis and interpretation of relatively difficult garden-path sentences (e.g., While Anna dressed the baby spit up on the bed). After reading such sentences, participants correctly believed that the baby spit up on the bed; however, they often confidently, yet incorrectly, believed that Anna dressed the baby. These results demonstrate that garden-path reanalysis is not an all-or-nothing process and that thematic roles initially assigned for the subordinate clause verb are not consistently revised. The implications of the partial reanalysis phenomenon for Fodor and Inoue's (1998) model of reanalysis and sentence processing are discussed. In addition, we discuss the possibility that language processing often creates "good enough" structures rather than ideal structures.},

This result is consistent with the predictions of several theories (Gibson, 2000; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005), and contradicts the recent claim (Levy, 2008) that in relative-clause structures increasing argument-verb distance makes processing easier at the verb. Levy's expectation-based account predicts that the expectation for a verb becomes sharper as distance is increased and therefore processing becomes easier at the verb. We argue that, in addition to expectation effects (which are seen in the eyetracking study in first-pass regression probability), processing load alsoincreases with increasing distance. This contradicts Levy's claim that heightened expectation leadsto lower processing cost. Dependency- resolution cost and expectation-based facilitation are jointly responsible for determining processing cost.},

Mixed- effects modeling (see, e.g., Baayen, Davidson, {\&} Bates, 2008) does not re- quire prior aggregation and allows the researcher the more ambitious goal of predicting individual responses. Mixed-modeling calls for a reconsideration of the classical methodological strategies for analysing rts. In this study, we argue for empirical flexibility with respect to the choice of transforma- tion for the rts. We advocate minimal a-priori data trimming, combined with model criticism. We also show how trial-to-trial, longitudinal depen- dencies between individual observations can be brought into the statistical model. These strategies are illustrated for a large dataset with a non-trivial random-effects structure. Special attention is paid to the evaluation of in- teractions involving fixed-effect factors that partition the levels sampled by random-effect factors.},

In English, there is a weak but seldom significant tendency for the relative clause to be taken as modifying the second noun phrase, the actress, but in Spanish, several researchers have found a significant preference for the relative clause's modifying the first noun phrase, la criada. The present experiments compare Spanish and English readers' eye movements while reading exactly comparable sentences in their native languages and find a significant reading time advantage in Spanish when it is forced to modify the first noun phrase, but in English when the relative clause is forced to modify the second noun phrase. Theoretical implications of the findings for previous explanations of the phenomenon are discussed.},

abstract = {In simple, go/no-go, and choice reaction time (RT) tasks, responses are faster to two redundant targets than to a single target. This redundancy gain has been explained in terms of a race model assuming that whichever target is processed faster determines RT (Raab, 1962). Miller (1982) presented a race model inequality to test the race model by comparing the RT distributions of single and redundant target conditions. Here, we present simulations indicating that the standard tests of this inequality (for a description of the testing algorithm, see Ulrich, Miller, {\&} Schr{\"{o}}ter, 2007) are afflicted with systematic biases and Type I error accumulation. Systematic biases tend to produce violations of the race model inequality, but they decrease as the numbers of observations increase. Reasonably unbiased tests of the race model inequality are obtained for sample sizes of at least 20 for each target condition. In addition, Type I error accumulates because of testing the inequality at multiple percentiles. To reduce Type I error, the race model inequality should be tested in a restricted range of percentiles, preferably in the percentile range 10{\%} to 25{\%}.},

The stop-signal paradigm has been successfully applied to assess the ability to inhibit under a wide range of experimental conditions and in various populations. The current study presents a set of evidence-based guidelines for using the stop-signal paradigm. The evidence was derived from a series of simulations aimed at (a) examining the effects of experimental design features on inhibition indices, and (b) testing the assumptions of the horse-race model that underlies the stop-signal paradigm. The simulations indicate that, under most conditions, the latency, but not variability, of response inhibition can be reliably estimated. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The MLR framework overcomes some of the problems with conventional analyses, making it possible to incorporate time as a continuous variable and gaze location as a categorical dependent variable. The multilevel approach minimizes the need for data aggregation and thus provides a more statistically powerful approach. With MLR, the researcher builds a mathematical model of the overall response curve that separates the response into different temporal components. The researcher can test hypotheses by examining the impact of independent variables and their interactions on these components. A worked example using MLR is provided. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A number of studies have explored the time course of Chinese semantic and syntactic processing. However, whether syntactic processing occurs earlier than semantics during Chinese sentence reading is still under debate. To further explore this issue, an event-related potentials (ERPs) experiment was conducted on 21 native Chinese speakers who read individually-presented Chinese simple sentences (NP1+VP+NP2) word-by-word for comprehension and made semantic plausibility judgments. The transitivity of the verbs was manipulated to form three types of stimuli: congruent sentences (CON), sentences with a semantically violated NP2 following a transitive verb (semantic violation, SEM), and sentences with a semantically violated NP2 following an intransitive verb (combined semantic and syntactic violation, SEM+SYN). The ERPs evoked from the target NP2 were analyzed by using the Residue Iteration Decomposition (RIDE) method to reconstruct the ERP waveform blurred by trial-to-trial variability, as well as by using the conventional ERP method based on stimulus-locked averaging. The conventional ERP analysis showed that, compared with the critical words in CON, those in SEM and SEM+SYN elicited an N400-P600 biphasic pattern. The N400 effects in both violation conditions were of similar size and distribution, but the P600 in SEM+SYN was bigger than that in SEM. Compared with the conventional ERP analysis, RIDE analysis revealed a larger N400 effect and an earlier P600 effect (in the time window of 500-800 ms instead of 570-810ms). Overall, the combination of conventional ERP analysis and the RIDE method for compensating for trial-to-trial variability confirmed the non-significant difference between SEM and SEM+SYN in the earlier N400 time window. Converging with previous findings on other Chinese structures, the current study provides further precise evidence that syntactic processing in Chinese does not occur earlier than semantic processing.},

abstract = {Which repair strategy does the language system deploy when it gets garden-pathed, and what can regressive eye movements in reading tell us about reanalysis strategies? Several influential eye-tracking studies on syntactic reanalysis (Frazier {\&} Rayner, 1982; Meseguer, Carreiras, {\&} Clifton, 2002; Mitchell, Shen, Green, {\&} Hodgson, 2008) have addressed this question by examining scanpaths, i.e., sequential patterns of eye fixations. However, in the absence of a suitable method for analyzing scanpaths, these studies relied on simplified dependent measures that are arguably ambiguous and hard to interpret. We address the theoretical question of repair strategy by developing a new method that quantifies scanpath similarity. Our method reveals several distinct fixation strategies associated with reanalysis that went undetected in a previously published data set (Meseguer et al., 2002). One prevalent pattern suggests re-parsing of the sentence, a strategy that has been discussed in the literature (Frazier {\&} Rayner, 1982); however, readers differed tremendously in how they orchestrated the various fixation strategies. Our results suggest that the human parsing system non-deterministically adopts different strategies when confronted with the disambiguating material in garden-path sentences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Given certain information relating to chosen distribution functions, one can estimate the parameters of these distributions and of finite mixtures of these distributions. In addition, left and/or right censoring or truncation may be imposed. Censoring and truncation are useful methods by which to accommodate outlying observations, which are a pervasive problem in RT research. We consider five RT distributions: the Weibull, the ex-Gaussian, the gamma, the log-normal, and the Wald. We employ quasi-Newton optimization to obtain ML estimates. Multicase distributional analyses can be carried out, which enable one to conduct detailed (across or within subjects) comparisons of RT data by means of loglikelihood difference tests. Parameters may be freely estimated, estimated subject to boundary constraints, constrained to be equal (within or over cases), or fixed. To demonstrate the feasibility of ML estimation and to illustrate some of the possibilities offered by the present approach, we present three small simulation studies. In addition, we present three illustrative analyses of real data.},

abstract = {The time-course with which readers use event-specific world knowledge (thematic fit) toresolve structural ambiguity was explored through experiments and implementation of constraint-based and two-stage models. In a norming study, subjects completed fragments that ended in theambiguous region of a reduced relative clause (The crook arrested/by/the/detective). Completion proportions up to and including the were influenced by thematic fit. The results were simulatedusing a competition model in which independently quantified syntactic and semantic constraints simultaneously influenced interpretation. Predictions were then generated for a self-paced readingtask using model parameter values established by the off-line simulations. The pattern of readingtimes matched the predictions of the constraint-based version of the model but differed substan-tially from a one-region delay garden-path version. In addition, a garden-path model with a veryshort delay simulated the data better than the one-region delay model, but not as closely as the constraint-based version. The experiment and modeling illustrate that thematic fit is computedand used immediately in on-line sentence comprehension. Furthermore, the modeling highlightedthe difficulty of interpreting sentence comprehension experiments without both quantifying therelevant constraints and implementing the mechanisms involved.},

This is clearly not the case. We argue that conversation is easy because of an interactive processing mechanism that leads to the alignment of linguistic representations between partners. Interactive alignment occurs via automatic alignment channels that are functionally similar to the automatic links between perception and behaviour (the so-called perception-behaviour expressway) proposed in recent accounts of social interaction. We conclude that humans are 'designed' for dialogue rather than monologue.},

Analysis revealed that: (1) The effect of the suggestion on interference is observed in $\mu$, supporting converging evidence indicating the suggestion operates over response competition mechanisms; and, (2) Contrary to Parris et al. an effect of the suggestion was observed in $\mu$ when RSI was 3500 ms. The reanalysis of the data from Parris et al. (2012) supports the utility of ex-Gaussian analysis in revealing effects that might otherwise be thought of as absent.

One that figures prominently in hypothesis testing is the null ritual, the pitting of hypotheses against chance. Although known to be problematic, this practice is still widely used. One way to resist the lure of the null ritual is to increase the precision of theories by casting them as formal models. These can be tested against each other, instead of against chance, which in turn enables a researcher to decide between competing theories based on quantitative measures. This article gives an overview of the advantages of modeling, describes research that is based on it, outlines the difficulties associated with model testing, and summarizes some of the solutions for dealing with these difficulties.

abstract = {Visual word recognition studies commonly measure the orthographic similarity of words using Coltheart's orthographic neighborhood size metric (ON). Although ON reliably predicts behavioral variability in many lexical tasks, its utility is inherently limited by its relatively restrictive definition. In the present article, we introduce a new measure of orthographic similarity generated using a standard computer science metric of string similarity (Levenshtein distance). Unlike ON, the new measure-named orthographic Levenshtein distance 20 (OLD20)-incorporates comparisons between all pairs of words in the lexicon, including words of different lengths. We demonstrate that OLD20 provides significant advantages over ON in predicting both lexical decision and pronunciation performance in three large data sets. Moreover, OLD20 interacts more strongly with word frequency and shows stronger effects of neighborhood frequency than does ON. The discussion section focuses on the implications of these results for models of visual word recognition.},

abstract = {In an eye movement experiment, we examined the use of reanalysis strategies during the reading of locally ambiguous but globally unambiguous Spanish sentences. Among other measures, we examined regressive eye movements made while readers were recovering in reading mild garden path sentences. The sentences had an adverbial clause that, depending on the mood (indicative vs. subjunctive) of the subordinate clause verb, could attach high (to the main verb of the sentence) or low (to the verb in the subordinate clause). Although Spanish speakers favor low attachment, the high attachment version was quite easy to understand. Readers predominately used two alternative strategies to recover from the mild garden path in our sentences. In the more common reanalysis strategy, their eyes regressed from the last region (disambiguation+ 1) directly to the main verb in the sentence. Following this, they reread the rest of the sentence, fixating the next region and the adverb (the beginning of the ambiguous part of the sentence). Less frequently, readers regressed from the last region (disambiguation+1) directly to the adverb. We argue that both types of strategies are consistent with a selective reanalysis process as described by Frazier and Rayner (1982).},

abstract = {This article examines the possibility that the components of an information- processing system all operate continuously, passing information from one to the next as it becomes available. A model called the cascade model is presented and it is shown to be compatible with the general form of the relation between time and accuracy in speed-accuracy trade-off experiments. In the model , ex- - perimentlLlmanipulations may have either or both of two effects on a process- ing level: They may alter the rate of response or the asymptotic quality pf the output. The effects of such manipulations on the output of a system of pro- essesare described. The model is then used to reexamine , the subtraction and additive factors methods for analyzing the composition of systems of processes. The examination of the additive factors method yields particularly interesting results. Among them is the finding that factors that affect the rates of two different processes would be expected to have additive effects on reaction times under the cascade model , whereas factors that both affect the rate of the same process would tend to interact, just as in the case in which the manipulations affect the durations of discrete stages. On the other hand , factors that affect asymptotic output tend to interact whether they affect the same or different processes. In light of this observation , the conclusions drawn from several studies about the locus of perceptual and attentional effects on processing are reexamined. Finally, an outline is presented of a new method for analyzing pro- cesses in cascade. The method extends the additive factors method to an anal- ysis of the parameters of the function relating response time and accuracy.},

@article{Heckler2015,
abstract = {We report on five experiments investigating response choices and response times to simple sci- ence questions that evoke student “misconceptions,” and we construct a simple model to explain the patterns of response choices. Physics students were asked to compare a physical quantity rep- resented by the slope, such as speed, on simple physics graphs. We found that response times of incorrect answers, resulting from comparing heights, were faster than response times of correct answers comparing slopes. This result alone might be explained by the fact that height was typi- cally processed faster than slope for this kind of task, which we confirmed in a separate experi- ment. However, we hypothesize that the difference in response time is an indicator of the cause (rather than the result) of the response choice. To support this, we found that imposing a 3-s delay in responding increased the number of students comparing slopes (answering correctly) on the task. Additionally a significant proportion of students recognized the correct written rule (compare slope), but on the graph task they incorrectly compared heights. Finally, training either with repet- itive examples or providing a general rule both improved scores, but only repetitive examples had a large effect on response times, thus providing evidence of dual paths or processes to a solution. Considering models of heuristics, information accumulation models, and models relevant to the Stroop effect, we construct a simple relative processing time model that could be viewed as a kind of fluency heuristic. The results suggest that misconception-like patterns of answers to some sci- ence questions commonly found on tests may be explained in part by automatic processes that involve the relative processing time of considered dimensions and a priority to answer quickly.},

abstract = {Eye movements were recorded as subjects read sentences containing temporary structural ambiguities. In accord with the garden-path theory of sentence comprehension, shorter reading times were found for sentences conforming to certain independently motivated parsing strategies (late closure and minimal attachment) than for comparable sentences which violate these strategies. Further, longer fixation durations were associated with the very first fixation in the region of the sentence which disambiguated the sentence, suggesting that the human sentence-parsing mechanism operates in a rather systematic fashion, immediately computing the structural consequences of fixated material for the analysis of preceding material. The pattern of regressive eye movements did not conform to the view that the parsing mechanism automatically returns to the beginning of the sentence to revise an incorrect analysis of linguistic material nor did it support the view that the parsing mechanism systematically backtracks through the sentence until the source of the erroneous analysis is located. Rather, the pattern of regressions indicated that the parsing mechanism typically engages in selective reanalysis, exploiting whatever information it has available about the type of error it has committed to guide its reanalysis attempts. Finally, it is emphasized that an understanding of the parser's revision procedures is essential to an explanation of why certain linguistic structures cannot be successfully parsed by humans. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

However, considerations of simplicity and evolutionary continuity suggest that hierarchical structure should not be invoked too hastily. Indeed, recent neurophysiological, behavioural and computational studies show that sequential sentence structure has considerable explanatory power and that hierarchical processing is often not involved. In this paper, we review evidence from the recent literature supporting the hypothesis that sequential structure may be fundamental to the comprehension, production and acquisition of human language. Moreover, we provide a preliminary sketch outlining a non-hierarchical model of language use and discuss its implications and testable predictions. If linguistic phenomena can be explained by sequential rather than hierarchical structure, this will have considerable impact in a wide range of fields, such as linguistics, ethology, cognitive neuroscience, psychology and computer science.},

abstract = {We show that comprehenders' expectations about upcoming discourse coherence relations influence the resolution of local structural ambiguity. We employ cases in which two clauses share both a syntactic relationship and a discourse relationship, and hence in which syntactic and discourse processing might be expected to interact. An off-line sentence-completion study and an on-line self-paced reading study examined readers' expectations for high/low relative-clause attachments following implicit-causality and non-implicit causality verbs (John detests/babysits the children of the musician who...). In the off-line study, the widely reported low-attachment preference for English is observed in the non-implicit causality condition, but this preference gives way to more high attachments in the implicit-causality condition in cases in which (i) the verb's causally implicated referent occupies the high-attachment position and (ii) the relative clause provides an explanation for the event described by the matrix clause (e.g., .... who are arrogant and rude). In the on-line study, a similar preference for high attachment emerges in the implicit-causality context-crucially, before the occurrence of any linguistic evidence that the RC does in fact provide an explanation-whereas the low-attachment preference is consistent elsewhere. These findings constitute the first demonstration that expectations about ensuing discourse coherence relationships can elicit full reversals in syntactic attachment preferences, and that these discourse-level expectations can affect on-line disambiguation as rapidly as lexical and morphosyntactic cues. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Syntactic rules in human language usually refer to the hierarchical structure of sentences. However, the input during language acquisition can often be explained equally well with rules based on linear order. The fact that children consistently ignore these linear explanations to instead settle on hierarchical explanations has been used to argue for an innate hierarchical bias in humans. We revisit this argument by using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have no hierarchical bias, to simulate the acquisition of question formation, a hierarchical transformation, in an artificial language modeled after English. Even though this transformation could be explained with a linear rule, we find that some RNN architectures consistently learn the correct hierarchical rule instead. This finding suggests that hierarchical cues within the language are sufficient to induce a preference for hierarchical generalization. This conclusion is strengthened by the finding that adding an additional hierarchical cue, namely syntactic agreement, further improves performance.},

the main tools used to study high-level cognition in preverbal infants.
Infants' differential looking to conceptually implausible/impossible
events has been used as an index of early cognitive competence in
many areas, including object knowledge, physics, language, and number.
However, an event's plausibility is commonly confounded with its
perceptual novelty or familiarity, leading to a variety of interpretations
for looking time data (Bogartz, Shinskey {\&} Speaker, 1997). This
illustrative study demonstrates the value of factorial designs, in
which perceptual (novelty-familiarity) and conceptual (possible-impossible)
variables are independently and jointly explored. It also introduces
pupil dilation as a viable and complementary dependent measure to
study infant cognition. We show that pupil data can assist in the
interpretation of otherwise equivocal looking time data. The discussion
focuses on methodological considerations in infancy research.},

These have played an important role in the tradition of gen-erative syntax and might therefore be expected to be universal, but they are usually argued to be absent from German. We looked for evidence of them in German data using the methodology of magnitude estimation of well-formedness, and compared this data with parallel results from English. The results showed these e¤ects to be robustly active in the grammar of Ger-man, and revealed few di¤erences between the two languages. We suggest that the reason why linguists have denied their existence in German is that they have been assuming a binary and categorical concept of grammatical-ity, forgetting that this is merely a simplifying abstraction from the primary linguistic data. We demonstrate that the admittedly convenient assumption of categorical grammaticality is obscuring our view of the syntax, and that studies using our own more empirically adequate assumptions of grammati-cality can be productive. In particular, we hope that our conceptions of constraint survivability and definition of syntax relevance may permit in-sights into the size of the grammar, crosslinguistic variation, and syntactic universals.},

In each of the experiments, two characters were introduced into the discourse before the anaphor, and only one of these characters was a grammatical antecedent for the anaphor in terms of binding theory. Both experiments showed that Principle A of the binding theory operates at the very earliest stages of processing; early eye-movement measures showed evidence of processing difficulty when the gender of the reflexive anaphor mismatched the stereotypical gender of the grammatical antecedent. However, the gender of the ungrammatical antecedent had no effect on early processing, although it affected processing during later stages in Experiment 1. An additional experiment showed that the gender of the ungrammatical antecedent also affected the likelihood of participants settling on an ungrammatical final interpretation. The results are interpreted in relation to the notions of bonding and resolution in reference processing.},

abstract = {Between-Task Double Dissociation is defined as a particular pattern of effects of two factors (manipulations) F and G on performance measures M-sub(T1 ) and M-sub(T2 ) in two tasks implemented by different complex processes. F and G might be the amounts of damage in two brain regions. The factors must influence the measures selectively: M-sub(T1 ) influenced by F but invariant with respect to G; M-sub(T2 ) influenced by G but invariant with respect to F. Let "dd(M-sub(T1), M-sub(T2); F, G)" denote this set of two influence properties and two invariance properties. Investigation of such cases may be called task comparison; what are dissociated are the complex processes used to carry out the two tasks. I consider in this paper a type of within-task double dissociation that can serve as evidence for the modularity of subprocesses of a single complex process, and is the basis of a method for process decomposition, an idea developed in detail in Sternberg (2001) with a dozen diverse applications. The inferential logic, summarized briefly in this article, depends on whether our measures of the subprocesses are "pure" or "composite". The comments that follow the summaries are intended to clarify some aspects of the logic; several also apply to between - task double dissociation.

Memory-based and expectation-based theories make opposite predictions regarding fine-grained time course of processing difficulty in syntactically constrained contexts, and each class of theory receives support from results on some constructions in some languages. Here we report four self-paced reading experiments on the online comprehension of Russian relative clauses together with related corpus studies, taking advantage of Russian's flexible word order to disentangle predictions of competing theories. We find support for key predictions of memory-based theories in reading times at RC verbs, and for key predictions of expectation-based theories in processing difficulty at RC-initial accusative noun phrase (NP) objects, which corpus data suggest should be highly unexpected. These results suggest that a complete theory of syntactic complexity must integrate insights from both expectation-based and memory-based theories. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {We compared two contrasting hypotheses of how multifeatured objects are stored in visual working memory (vWM); as integrated objects or as independent features. A new procedure was devised to examine vWM representations of several concurrently held objects and their features and our main measure was reaction time (RT), allowing an examination of the real-time search through features and/or objects in an array in vWM. Response speeds to probes with color, shape, or both were studied as a function of the number of memorized colored shapes. Four testing groups were created by varying the instructions and the way in which probes with both color and shape were presented. The instructions explicitly either encouraged or discouraged the use of binding information and the task-relevance of binding information was further suggested by presenting probes with both color and shapes as either integrated objects or independent features. Our results show that the unit used for retrieval from vWM depends on the testing situation. Search was fully object-based only when all factors support that basis of search, in which case retrieving 2 features took no longer than retrieving a single feature. Otherwise, retrieving 2 features took longer than retrieving a single feature. Additional analyses of change detection latency suggested that, even though different testing situations can result in a stronger emphasis on either the feature dimension or the object dimension, neither one disappears from the representation and both concurrently affect change detection performance.

We combine a popular model for choice response times-the Wiener diffusion process-with techniques from psychometrics in order to construct a hierarchical diffusion model. Chief among these techniques is the application of random effects, with which we allow for unexplained variability among participants, items, or other experimental units. These techniques lead to a modeling framework that is highly flexible and easy to work with. Among the many novel models this statistical framework provides are a multilevel diffusion model, regression diffusion models, and a large family of explanatory diffusion models.

abstract = {The mechanisms by which antidepressant-induced neurochemical changes lead to physiological changes in brain circuitry and ultimately an antidepressant response remain unclear. This study investigated the effects of sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant, on corticolimbic connectivity, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In all, 12 unmedicated unipolar depressed patients and 11 closely matched healthy control subjects completed two fMRI scanning sessions at baseline and after 6 weeks. Depressed patients received treatment with sertraline between the two sessions. During each fMRI session, subjects first completed a conventional block-design experiment. Next, connectivity between cortical and limbic regions was measured using correlations of low-frequency blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fluctuations (LFBF) during continuous exposure to neutral, positive, and negative pictures. At baseline, depressed patients had decreased corticolimbic LFBF correlations compared to healthy subjects during the resting state and on exposure to emotionally valenced pictures. At rest and on exposure to neutral and positive pictures, LFBF correlation between the anterior cingulate cortex and limbic regions was significantly increased in patients after treatment. However, on exposure to negative pictures, corticolimbic LFBF correlations remained decreased in depressed patients. The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that antidepressant treatment may increase corticolimbic connectivity, thereby possibly increasing the regulatory influence of cortical mood-regulating regions over limbic regions.},

- wmc multicomponent system for maintaining information in the face of ongoing processing and/or distraction
- clear distinction between stmc and wmc (stmc domain-specific, wmc domain-general)
- no distinction between verbal and other wmc
- wmc measures created to include not only rehearsal, but also a simultaneous processing component (reading, counting, operating, symmetry judging, etc.)
- later true/false for sentences {\textgreater} avoided strategy that supported focusing only on the recall component
- later not increasing, but randomized order of set sizes
- processing does not have to be reading


recommendations for administration
- immediate and vigilant stimulus presentation (delay might permit rehearsal, turning the wmc task into a stmc task)
- individual administration (distraction in groups, etc.)
- sufficient item size (at least 5, otherwise ceiling effects likely)


scoring
- correlational evidence from studies on adults supports the common practice to not consider processing performance in the wmc span score
- performance on processing usually positively correlated with recall
- no evidence for processing-storage-tradeoff
- absolute scores (d{\{}{\&}{\}}c) problematic, because difficulty of span set might vary on many dimensions (sentence length, operation difficulty, etc.)
{\textgreater} absolute span scores inadequate
- instead: correct and incorrect numerically coded, no distinction between error types
- credit when processing wrong? {\textgreater} yes
- full or partial credit for imperfect recall?
- different weight for longer sets?
{\textgreater} equally: score proportion of each set and then overall proportion (1/2 the same as 3/6)
{\textgreater} pcu, pcl, anl, anu
- partial-credit clear advantage in terms of internal consistency, within these unit-weighted scores better


- wmc tests reliable (cronbach's alpha, split/half consistency, etc.)


- all tasks show strong validity, predict performance on broad array of measures that involve attention and/or memory
- show discriminant validity insofar as they do not predict performance on relatively automatic tasks (prosaccade)


wmc vs. other tasks
- stm no unique variance in general cog. ability, when wmc partialled out, but correlation between those to weak to conclude, that they represent the same construct
- to most effectively measure wmc, task must contain processing component
- not clear, if processing has to be unrelated to storage


optimal research strategy: several wmc measures plus latent variable analysis
- con: multiple measures and large samples needed


extreme-group designs:
- categorizing continuous variable problematic, because 1) information and power are lost, 2) subjects who are not equal are treated as if they were, 3) misclassification can occur
- especially true, when magnitude of relationship between wmc and other measure is in question
- good to check, whether or not a relationship is there or not
- then: upper and lower quartile
- do not use median splits: 1) no reason to categorize, when entire sample has been sampled, 2) misclassification is more likely than with quartiles},

abstract = {People comprehend utterances rapidly and without conscious effort. Traditional theories assume that sentence processing is algorithmic and that meaning is derived compositionally. The language processor is believed to generate representations of the linguistic input that are complete, detailed, and accurate. However, recent findings challenge these assumptions. Investigations of the misinterpretation of both garden-path and passive sentences have yielded support for the idea that the meaning people obtain for a sentence is often not a reflection of its true content. Moreover, incorrect interpretations may persist even after syntactic reanalysis has taken place. Our good-enough approach to language comprehension holds that language processing is sometimes only partial and that semantic representations are often incomplete. Future work will elucidate the conditions under which sentence processing is simply good enough.},

abstract = {The three-parameter Weibull distribution is a commonly-used distribution for the study of reliability and breakage data. However, given a data set, it is difficult to estimate the parameters of the distribution and that, for many reasons: (1) the equations of the maximum likelihood estimators are not all available in closed form. These equations can be estimated using iterative methods. However, (2) they return biased estimators and the exact amount of bias is not known. (3) The Weibull distribution does not meet the regularity conditions so that in addition to being biased, the maximum likelihood estimators may also be highly variable from one sample to another (weak efficiency). The methods to estimate parameters of a distribution can be divided into three classes: a) the maximizing approaches, such as the maximum likelihood method, possibly followed by a bias-correction operation; b) the methods of moments; and c) a mixture of the previous two classes of methods. We found using Monte Carlo simulations that a mixed method was the most accurate to estimate the parameters of the Weibull distribution across many shapes and sample sizes, followed by the weighted maximum likelihood estimation method. If the shape parameter is known to be larger than 1, the maximum product of spacing method is the most accurate whereas in the opposite case, the mixed method is to be preferred. A test that can detect if the shape parameter is smaller than 1 is discussed and evaluated. Overall, the maximum likelihood estimation method was the worst, with errors of estimation almost twice as large as those of the best methods.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Language contact plays a key part among the factors leading to change in grammars, and yet the study of syntactic change, especially in the generative or innatist tradition, has tended to neglect the role of contact in this process. At the same time, work on contact-induced change remains largely descriptive, with theoretical discussion restricted mostly to the putative limits on borrowing. This article aims at moving beyond these restrictions by outlining a psycholinguistically-based account of some of the ways in which contact leads to change. This account takes Van Coetsem's (1988, 2000) distinction between recipient-language and source-language agentivity as its starting point, building on this insight in the light of work on language acquisition and first language attrition, and showing how these principles can be integrated into a unified acquisitionist model of syntactic change in general. The model is then applied to case studies of contact-induced syntactic change in Yiddish and Berber.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The ability to hold information briefly in mind in the absence of external stimulation forms the core of much of higher-order cognition. This ability is referred to as short-term memory (STM). However, single-term labels such as this belie the complexity of the underlying construct. Here, we review evidence that STM is an amalgamation of three qualitatively distinct states. We argue that these distinct states emerge from the combination of frontal selection mechanisms (often considered the domain of attention and cognitive control), medial temporal binding mechanisms (often considered the domain of long-term memory, LTM), and synaptic plasticity. These various contributions lead to a single representation amenable to elaborated processing (focus of attention), a limited set of active representations among which attention can be flexibly switched (direct-access region), and passive representations whose residual traces facilitate re-activation (activated LTM). We suggest that selection and binding mechanisms are typically engaged simultaneously, providing multiple forms and routes of short-term maintenance. We propose that such a framework can resolve discrepancies among recent studies that have attempted to understand the relationship between attention and STM on the one hand, and between LTM and STM on the other. We anticipate that recent advances in neuroimaging and neurophysiology will elucidate the mechanisms underlying shifts and transformations among these representational states, providing a window into the dynamic processes of higher-order cognition.},

abstract = {Because morphological and syntactic constraints govern the distribution of potential antecedents for local anaphors, local antecedent retrieval might be expected to make equal use of both syntactic and morphological cues. However, previous research (e.g., Dillon et al., 2013) has shown that local antecedent retrieval is not susceptible to the same morphological interference effects observed during the resolution of morphologically-driven grammatical dependencies, such as subject-verb agreement checking (e.g., Pearlmutter et al., 1999). Although this lack of interference has been taken as evidence that syntactic cues are given priority over morphological cues in local antecedent retrieval, the absence of interference could also be the result of a confound in the materials used: the post-verbal position of local anaphors in prior studies may obscure morphological interference that would otherwise be visible if the critical anaphor were in a different position. We investigated the licensing of local anaphors (reciprocals) in Hindi, an SOV language, in order to determine whether pre-verbal anaphors are subject to morphological interference from feature-matching distractors in a way that post-verbal anaphors are not. Computational simulations using a version of the ACT-R parser (Lewis and Vasishth, 2005) predicted that a feature-matching distractor should facilitate the processing of an unlicensed reciprocal if morphological cues are used in antecedent retrieval. In a self-paced reading study we found no evidence that distractors eased processing of an unlicensed reciprocal. However, the presence of a distractor increased difficulty of processing following the reciprocal. We discuss the significance of these results for theories of cue selection in retrieval.},

The temporary ambiguity concerned whether a noun following a verb was its direct object (The senator regretted the decision immediately.), or instead the subject of an embedded clause (The senator regretted the decision had been made public.). The experiments crossed the plausibility of the temporarily ambiguous noun as a direct object (e.g., The senator regretted the decision . . . vs The senator regretted the reporter . . with verb bias, eliminating a confound present in earlier research and allowing an examination of interactions between the two factors. Unbiased verbs were included as well to evaluate the role of plausibility in the absence of verb bias. The results generally replicated Trueswell, Tanenhaus, and Kellos (1993) finding that verb bias has rapid effects on ambiguity resolution, and showed in addition that verb bias and plausibility interact during comprehension. The results are most consistent with parallel interactive models of language comprehension such as constraint satisfaction models.},

Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and shape) can be predicted at the same time thus allowing for distributional regression. Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness with four examples, each showing other relevant aspects of the syntax.},

In less than ten years the question of how disfluencies are handled by the human sentence comprehension system has gone from virtually ignored to a topic of major interest in computational linguistics and psycholinguistics. We discuss relevant empirical findings and describe a computational model that captures how disfluencies influence parsing and comprehension. The research reviewed shows that the parser, which presumably evolved to handle conversations, deals with disfluencies in a way that is efficient and linguistically principled. The success of this research program reinforces the current trend in cognitive science to view cognitive mechanisms as adaptations to real-world constraints and challenges.},

The experiments tested the prediction that comprehenders should avoid the RC analysis because it involves an unforced filler-gap dependency. Readers showed difficulty upon disambiguation toward the RC analysis, and showed facilitated processing of the ambiguous material itself when the CC analysis was available; both patterns suggest rapid initial adoption of the CC analysis in preference to the RC analysis. The strength of the bias of a specific head noun (e.g., information) to appear with a CC did not modulate these effects, nor were these effects reliably modulated by the tendency of an ambiguous string to be completed off-line as a CC or an RC. These results add to the evidence that structural principles guide the processing of filler-gap dependencies.},

We examine the impact of the Rumelhart and McClelland model with the benefit of 25 years of hindsight. It is not clear who "won" the debate. It is clear, however, that the core ideas that the model instantiated have been assimilated into many areas in the study of language, changing the focus of research from abstract characterizations of linguistic competence to an emphasis on the role of the statistical structure of language in acquisition and processing.},

We find that their it relative clause processing result was due to a garden path like effect caused by participants misinterpreting the referent of the grammatical subject of the sentence containing the relative clause, rather than any inherent properties of the relative clause itself. We also find that when reduced object relative clauses are taken into account, it occurs more frequently in object relative clauses than subject relative clauses. Our results are broadly consistent with expectation-based accounts of processing, but not with a fine-grained account that would predict different behavior for reduced and unreduced object relative clauses. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Reading was faster when the context stereotypically provided a single possible referent for a definite DP or multiple possible referents for an indefinite DP than when context and DP definiteness were mismatched. This finding goes beyond previous evidence that definite DPs are processed more rapidly than are indefinite DPs when there is a unique or familiar referent in the context, showing that readers are sensitive to the semantics and pragmatics of (in)definiteness. However, the finding was obtained only when readers had to perform a simple arithmetic task between reading a sentence and seeing a question about it. The intervening task may have encouraged them to process the sentence more deeply in order to form a representation that would persist while doing the arithmetic. The methodological implications of this observation are discussed.},

abstract = {We introduce a method for measuring the number and durations of processing stages from the electroencephalographic signal and apply it to the study of associative recognition. Using an extension of past research that combines multivariate pattern analysis with hidden semi-Markov models, the approach identifies on a trial-by-trial basis where brief sinusoidal peaks (called bumps) are added to the ongoing electroencephalographic signal. We propose that these bumps mark the onset of critical cognitive stages in processing. The results of the analysis can be used to guide the development of detailed process models. Applied to the associative recognition task, the hidden semi-Markov models multivariate pattern analysis method indicates that the effects of associative strength and probe type are localized to a memory retrieval stage and a decision stage. This is in line with a previously developed the adaptive control of thought-rational process model, called ACT-R, of the task. As a test of the generalization of our method we also apply it to a data set on the Sternberg working memory task collected by Jacobs, Hwang, Curran, and Kahana (2006). The analysis generalizes robustly, and localizes the typical set size effect in a late comparison/decision stage. In addition to providing information about the number and durations of stages in associative recognition, our analysis sheds light on the event-related potential components implicated in the study of recognition memory.

This fMRI study examined whether all the complementation options are activated even in contexts where this seems unnecessary. We examined whether introducing the selected complement prior to the verb (in topicalised sentences) still involves the activation of all complementation options. We performed ROI analyses in the left STG, a brain region that has been linked to the processing of argument structure and the number of complementation options. In this region, multiple-option verbs elicited greater activations compared with one-option verbs, both when the complement appeared after the verb and when it appeared pre-verbally. This suggests encapsulated lexical retrieval of the verb, which involves exhaustive activation of all its complementation options when the verb is accessed.},

electroencephalogram (EEG) has been proposedas an objective measure
of alertness, but it is not clear how it compares withother measures.
In this study, the waking EEG was measured in the daytime todetermine
the presence of diurnal variations in the activity of standardfrequency
bands and to compare these variations with the temporal patternstypical
of sleep propensity and subjective alertness. Alertness was evaluated
infour men and 12 women, aged 19±33 y. Assessments were conducted
every 2 h, from10.00 to 24.00, in the following order: a visual analogue
scale of alertness, awaking EEG recording and a sleep latency test.
The waking EEG was recorded witheyes open. For each recording session,
32±60 s of artefact-free signals wereselected from the C3/A2 derivation,
then subjected to amplitude spectralanalysis. Four EEG frequency
bands showed significant diurnal variations: delta,theta, sigma and
beta1. None of these variations showed a significant correlationwith
the temporal patterns of sleep latencies or subjective alertness.
At theindividual level, however, theta band activity increased when
subjectivealertness decreased, suggesting that the theta band can
be used to monitorvariations in alertness in a given individual,
even at the moderate levels ofsleepiness experienced during the daytime.},

abstract = {The relationship between focus and new information has been unclear despite being the subject of several information structure studies. Here, we report an eye-tracking experiment that explored the relationship between them in on-line discourse processing in Chinese reading. Focus was marked by the Chinese focus-particle "shi", which is equivalent to the cleft structure "it was... who..." in English. New information was defined as the target word that was not present in previous contexts. Our results show that, in the target region, focused information was processed more quickly than non-focused information, while new information was processed more slowly than given information. These results reveal differences in processing patterns between focus and newness, and suggest that they are different concepts that relate to different aspects of cognitive processing. In addition, the effect of new/given information occurred in the post-target region for the focus condition, but not for the non-focus condition, suggesting a complex relationship between focus and newness in the discourse integration stage.},

abstract = {Experimental studies on polysemy have come to contradictory conclusions on whether words with multiple senses are stored as separate or shared mental representations. The present study examined the semantic relatedness and semantic similarity of literal and non-literal (metonymic and metaphorical) senses of three word classes: nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Two methods were used: a psycholinguistic experiment and a distributional analysis of corpus data. In the experiment, participants were presented with 6-12 short phrases containing a polysemous word in literal, metonymic, or metaphorical senses and were asked to classify them so that phrases with the same perceived sense were grouped together. To investigate the impact of professional background on their decisions, participants were controlled for linguistic vs. non-linguistic education. For nouns and verbs, all participants preferred to group together phrases with literal and metonymic senses, but not any other pairs of senses. For adjectives, two pairs of senses were often grouped together: literal with metonymic, and metonymic with metaphorical. Participants with a linguistic background were more accurate than participants with non-linguistic backgrounds, although both groups shared principal patterns of sense classification. For the distributional analysis of corpus data, we used a semantic vector approach to quantify the similarity of phrases with literal, metonymic, and metaphorical senses in the corpora. We found that phrases with literal and metonymic senses had the highest degree of similarity for the three word classes, and that metonymic and metaphorical senses of adjectives had the highest degree of similarity among all word classes. These findings are in line with the experimental results. Overall, the results suggest that the mental representation of a polysemous word depends on its word class. In nouns and verbs, literal and metonymic senses are stored together, while metaphorical senses are stored separately; in adjectives, metonymic senses significantly overlap with both literal and metaphorical senses.},

@article{McElree:2006,
abstract = {It has long been recognized that our ability to actively attend to and concurrently process information is limited (Broadbent, 1958). Nonetheless, component operations in many cognitive skills often rely on the products of prior perceptual and cognitive analyses. For example, subgoals in problem solving and reasoning can rely on the products of earlier subgoals (Anderson, 1983). Similarly, in language understanding, comprehenders frequently need to resolve dependencies between elements separated by several phrases or clauses (McElree, 2000; McElree, Foraker, {\&} Dyer, 2003). As ongoing operations will often displace past analyses from the current focus of attention, successful execution of many operations may depend on our ability to rapidly shunt information between memory and focal attention. Many researchers have suggested that a working memory (WM) system partially compensates for our limited capacity to concurrently process information. Working memory is thought to provide a "workspace," where a few by-products of recent perceptual and cognitive processing can be maintained in a more accessible state than information in long-term memory (LTM). Working memory representations may be more accessible than LTM representations either because they are held in specialized stores (Baddeley, 1986; Baddeley {\&} Hitch, 1974; Schneider {\&} Detweiler, 1988; Shallice {\&} Vallar, 1990) or simply because they have residual activation from recent processing (Anderson, 1983; Conway {\&} Engle, 1994; Cowan, 1995, 2001; Engle, 1996; Ericsson {\&} Pennington, 1993). If one posits a distinct WM system, as illustrated in Fig. 1A, information can be represented in three possible states, either in LTM, WM, or in the current focus of attention. Different forms of evidence have been used to motivate this type of tripartite architecture (Cowan, 1995, 2001). However, the evidence is indirect and can be challenged on several grounds (Crowder, 1993; Nairne, 1996; Wickelgren, 1973). This chapter examines whether there is direct evidence for either qualitative or quantitative differences in retrieval for items that the framework in Fig. 1A posits to be in distinct representational states. Different states could be motivated by findings that a qualitatively different type of retrieval operation is used to access information in each state. Alternatively or additionally, the architecture in Fig. 1A could be motivated by discontinuities in retrieval speed. This prediction is illustrated in Fig. 1B. The ultimate success of retrieval will be limited by forgetting due to the passage of time or intervening items between study and test, which should lead to systematic declines in accuracy with diminished recency. However, a straightforward prediction of a tripartite architecture is that each state should be associated with a distinct retrieval speed. Information in the current focus of attention should exhibit a privileged form of access. Less recent representations-those that are outside the capacity of focal attention but still within the span of WM-should be accessed slower than items within focal attention but faster than LTM representations. Finally, information that resides in LTM should be associated with the slowest retrieval speed. This chapter reviews studies on the speed and accuracy of accessing representations of recently processed information. It documents the types of retrieval operations used to access both item and order information. Evidence is presented indicating that item information is retrieved with a direct-access (content-addressable) process (Section II. B), whereas order information is retrieved by a slower serial search process (Section II. C). Crucially, however, in neither case do we find evidence for a qualitative or quantitative "break-point" between what a tripartite architecture posits as the divide between WM and LTM. Collectively, the temporal dynamics of retrieval are indicative of two rather than three representational states. These measures provide clear evidence for a distinction between information within the current focus of attention and information passively stored in memory but not a further distinction corresponding to WM and LTM. Rather, the evidence suggests the type of dichotomy illustrated in Fig. 2A in which there is only an architectural difference between representations in focal attention and representations in memory. The corresponding speed and accuracy profiles are illustrated in Fig. 2B. Like Fig. 1B, the probability of retrieving an item from memory decreases continuously as more information is interpolated between study and test. Here, however, accessibility shows a sharply dichotomous pattern. Items within focal attention are accessed quickly, but all other items outside attention are accessed more slowly and with the same retrieval speed. The architecture in Fig. 2A hearkens back to the simple dichotomy James (1890) drew between primary memory, which he regarded as synonymous with conscious awareness, and secondary memory, the repository of all passive memory representations. The second emphasis of the chapter is on the capacity of focal attention. Information in focal attention can be discriminated from information in a more passive state by its relatively fast retrieval dynamics (Section III. A). This view is reinforced by two new experiments that measure changes in retrieval dynamics that result from explicit attempts to shunt information from memory to focal attention (Sections III. B and III. C). Estimates of focal attention based on retrieval speed measures indicate that it has a much smaller capacity than has typically been assumed in some current approaches (Cowan, 2001). This view is reinforced further by studies that challenge subjects to attempt to retain items in focal attention while concurrently processing other information (Section III. D). The chapter ends with a brief discussion of neuroimaging findings. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A number of recent electrophysiological studies of sentence processing have shown that a subclass of syntactic violations elicits very rapid ERP responses, occurring within around 200 ms of the onset of the violation. Such findings raise the question of how it is possible to diagnose violations so quickly. This paper suggests that very rapid diagnosis of errors is possible specifically in situations where the diagnosis problem is tightly constrained by specific expectations generated before the critical word is presented. In an event-related potentials (ERP) study of visual sentence reading participants encountered violations of a word order constraint (...Max's of...) that has elicited early ERP responses in previous studies. Across conditions the illicit sequence was held constant, while sentence context was used to manipulate the expectation for a noun following the possessor Max's, by manipulating the possibility of ellipsis of the head noun. Results showed that the anterior negativity elicited by the word category violation was attenuated when the availability of ellipsis reduced the expectation for a noun in the position of the offending preposition of, with divergence between conditions starting around 200 ms after the onset of the violation. This suggests a role for structural expectations in accounting for very fast syntactic diagnosis processes.},

The advantages of CV include theoretic simplicity and practical feasibility. Despite its prominence, however, the limitations of CV are often underappreciated. Here we demonstrate the limitations of a particular form of CV --Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation or LOO-- with three concrete examples. In each example, a data set of infinite size is perfectly in line with the predictions of a simple model (i.e., a general law or invariance). Nevertheless, LOO shows bounded and relatively modest support for the simple model. We conclude that CV is not a panacea for model selection.},

This type of noise has been encountered in a number of biological and physical systems and is theorized to be a signature of dynamic complexity. Its presence in psychological data appears to be associated with the most elementary aspect of cognitive process, the formation of representations.},

Psychonomic Bulletin {\&} Review, 1–7. https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-017-1274-zWe investigated the time course of morphological processing during spoken word recognition using the printed-word paradigm. Chinese participants were asked to listen to a spoken disyllabic compound word while simultaneously viewing a printed-word display. Each visual display consisted of three printed words: a semantic associate of the first constituent of the compound word (morphemic competitor), a semantic associate of the whole compound word (whole-word competitor), and an unrelated word (distractor). Participants were directed to detect whether the spoken target word was on the visual display. Results indicated that both the morphemic and whole-word competitors attracted more fixations than the distractor. More importantly, the morphemic competitor began to diverge from the distractor immediately at the acoustic offset of the first constituent, which was earlier than the whole-word competitor. These results suggest that lexical access to the auditory word is incremental and morphological processing (i.e., semantic access to the first constituent) that occurs at an early processing stage before access to the representation of the whole word in Chinese.},

It is often claimed that the possession of some or other system-property is a necessary condition for that system to be modular in Fodor's sense, but Fodor made it clear that he was not proposing a definition of modularity, nor proposing any necessary conditions for the applicability of the term. He was simply suggesting a number of system properties that are typical of modular systems. I argue that it is nevertheless possible to derive a useful definition of modularity from the kinds of arguments put forward by Fodor: A cognitive system is modular when and only when it is domain-specific. Given any such proposed module, the other features of modularity discussed by Fodor should be dealt with as empirical issues: for each feature (innateness, for example), it is an empirical question whether or not the proposed module has that feature.},

As a case study, we apply methods developed by Beber and Scacco to analyze polling station counts in Helmand province for the four leading candidates in the 2009 Afghanistan presidential election. In this election, there were allegations of extensive electoral fraud, and nineteen percent of all votes cast were ultimately discarded. The pattern of statistical anomalies present in the raw polling station data is consistent with the findings of the post-election audit conducted by the Afghanistan Electoral Complaints Commission. The strengths and weaknesses of statistical methods for anomaly detection are discussed, as are possible motives for perpetuating voter fraud in elections that pose little uncertainty in projected outcomes.},

For decades researchers have assessed the interactions and dissociations across memory systems and representational states using behavioral investigations, seeking for the key principles that govern them. Recent advances in neuroscience have provided the field with a new set of tools that can be employed to complement and extend previous efforts by means of assessing the corresponding underlying neural mechanisms. In an effort to move toward a more unified perspective, this research topic brought together a collection of empirical, theoretical and review articles that collectively advance our understanding of representational states in memory, as well as bear the potential to reconcile some of the differences across the models. The authors conclude by highlighting several venues for future research. Recent advances in neuroscience now enable powerful approaches that combine behavioral indices along with complementary neuroscience methods that can utilize univariate and multivariate analyses of neuroimaging data on healthy individuals, as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation and lesion studies to test and infer similarities and dissociations across the hypothesized states of memory.

Recently, several self-paced reading studies have presented surprising evidence that object relatives in Chinese are easier to process than subject relatives. We carried out three self-paced reading experiments that attempted to replicate these results. Two of our three studies found a subject-relative preference, and the third study found an object-relative advantage. Using a random effects bayesian meta-analysis of fifteen studies (including our own), we show that the overall current evidence for the subject-relative advantage is quite strong (approximate posterior probability of a subject-relative advantage given the data: 78-80{\%}). We argue that retrieval/integration based accounts would have difficulty explaining all three experimental results. These findings are important because they narrow the theoretical space by limiting the role of an important class of explanation-retrieval/integration cost-at least for relative clause processing in Chinese.},

abstract = {Dzhafarov (1992, J. Math. Psych. 36, 2355268) analyzed additive decompositions of simple response time (RT) into two random variables: a signal-independent component and a component stochastically decreasing and vanishing as signal magnitude increases. The asymptotic behavior of RT (the dependence of RT of a given quan-tile rank on signal magnitude in the region of sufficiently large signals) was shown to be different under different models of stochastic rela-tionship between the two RT components. As a simple alternative to the more traditional stochastic independence model, according to which the two RT components have stochastically independent sour-ces of random variability, Dzhafarov proposed a single-variate RT decomposition model (SVRT) according to which the two com-ponents are increasing functions of a single common source of random variability. The two models predict distinctly different patterns of the asymptotic RT behavior on a population level. Our computer simula-tions show, however, that if Dzhafarov's test based on this difference is applied to RT samples generated according to the stochastic inde-pendence model, the results can sometimes mimic the asymptotic predictions of the SVRT model. This happens because of the uncer-tainty in determining the range of signals thatarsufficiently large'' to warrant asymptotic approximations. This difficulty can be overcome if instead of choosing a fixed range of large signals one repeatedly applies the test to a sequence of nested regions of large signals. Our computer simulations show that with this approach the two models can be reliably discriminated on realistically sized RT samples. ]},

abstract = {There is a wealth of evidence showing that increasing the distance between an argument and its head leads to more processing effort, namely, locality effects; these are usually associated with constraints in working memory (DLT: Gibson, 2000; activation-based model: Lewis and Vasishth, 2005). In SOV languages, however, the opposite effect has been found: antilocality (see discussion in Levy et al., 2013). Antilocality effects can be explained by the expectation-based approach as proposed by Levy (2008) or by the activation-based model of sentence processing as proposed by Lewis and Vasishth (2005). We report an eye-tracking and a self-paced reading study with sentences in Spanish together with measures of individual differences to examine the distinction between expectation- and memory-based accounts, and within memory-based accounts the further distinction between DLT and the activation-based model. The experiments show that (i) antilocality effects as predicted by the expectation account appear only for high-capacity readers; (ii) increasing dependency length by interposing material that modifies the head of the dependency (the verb) produces stronger facilitation than increasing dependency length with material that does not modify the head; this is in agreement with the activation-based model but not with the expectation account; and (iii) a possible outcome of memory load on low-capacity readers is the increase in regressive saccades (locality effects as predicted by memory-based accounts) or, surprisingly, a speedup in the self-paced reading task; the latter consistent with good-enough parsing (Ferreira et al., 2002). In sum, the study suggests that individual differences in working memory capacity play a role in dependency resolution, and that some of the aspects of dependency resolution can be best explained with the activation-based model together with a prediction component.},

abstract = {To investigate eye-movement control in reading, the present thesis
examined three phenomena related to the eyes' landing position within
words, (1) the optimal viewing position (OVP), (2) the preferred
viewing location (PVL), and (3) the Fixation-Duration Inverted-Optimal
Viewing Position (IOVP) Effect. Based on a corpus-analytical approach
(Exp. 1), the influence of variables word length, launch site distance,
and word frequency was systematically explored. In addition, five
experimental manipulations were conducted.First, word center was
identified as the OVP, that is the position within a word where refixation
probability is minimal. With increasing launch site distance, however,
the OVP was found to move towards the word beginning. Several possible
causes of refixations were discussed. The issue of refixation saccade
programming was extensively investigated, suggesting that pre-planned
and directly controlled refixation saccades coexist. Second, PVL
curves, that is landing position distributions, show that the eyes
are systematically deviated from the OVP, due to visuomotor constraints.
By far the largest influence on mean and standard deviation of the
Gaussian PVL curve was exhibited by launch site distance. Third,
it was investigated how fixation durations vary as a function of
landing position. The IOVP effect was replicated: Fixations located
at word center are longer than those falling near the edges of a
word. The effect of word frequency and/or launch site distance on
the IOVP function mainly consisted in a vertical displacement of
the curve. The Fixation-Duration IOVP effect is intriguing because
word center (the OVP) would appear to be the best place to fixate
and process a word. A critical part of the current work was devoted
to investigate the origin of the effect. It was suggested that the
IOVP effect arises as a consequence of mislocated fixations, i.e.
fixations on unintended words, which are caused by saccadic errors.
An algorithm for estimating the proportion of mislocated fixations
from empirical data was developed, based on extrapolations of landing
position distributions beyond word boundaries. As a new central theoretical
claim it was suggested that a new saccade program is started immediately
if the intended target word is missed. On average, this will lead
to decreased durations for mislocated fixations. Because mislocated
fixations were shown to be most prevalent at the beginning and end
of words, the proposed mechanism generated the inverted U-shape for
fixation durations when computed as a function of landing position.
The proposed mechanism for generating the effect is generally compatible
with both oculomotor and cognitive models of eye-movement control
in reading. },

abstract = {Although the normal probability distribution is the cornerstone of applying statistical methodology; data do not always meet the necessary normal distribution assumptions. In these cases, researchers often transform non-normal data to a distribution that is approximately normal. Power transformations constitute a family of transformations, which include logarithmic and fractional exponent transforms. The Box-Cox method offers a simple method for choosing the most appropriate power transformation. Another option for data that is positively skewed, often used when measuring reaction times, is the Ex-Gaussian distribution which is a combination of the exponential and normal distributions. In this paper, the Box-Cox power transformation and Ex-Gaussian distribution will be discussed and compared in the context of positively skewed data. This discussion will demonstrate that the Box-Cox power transformation is simpler to apply and easier to interpret than the Ex-Gaussian distribution.},

abstract = {Reply by the current author to the comments made by J. F. Rouder (see record 2005-11473-009) and Michael J. Wenger (see record 2005-11473-010) on the original article (see record 2005-11473-008). Rouder focuses on my restriction to a log normal RT model with two parameters, a scale parameter {\^{I}}¼, and a shape parameter {\"{I}}‚, of which only the first one is treated as a function of person and item characteristics. A shift parameter is lacking and Rouder gives an example and references to show the need for such a parameter. With respect to the shape parameter, my focus on the scale parameter may have created a misunderstanding that the shape parameter was restricted to be the same for all persons and items. Wenger welcomes my contribution to the simultaneous modeling of both response correctness and RT, but raises several theoretical issues. First, he questions the assumption that many cognitive tasks can be solved correctly given unlimited time, referring to the occurrence of noise or perturbations during information processing. This is correct, but the many reports of RT experiments with error rates smaller than 5{\%}, including one on mental rotation by myself, raise the question on how critical this assumption is. The logistic model for response correctness might be extended with an upper bound to accommodate non-zero error rates. But the statistical complications of the three-parameter IRT model suggest that the costs of this extension may outweigh its benefits. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)},

Processing difficulty associated with the syntactic reanalysis was largely localised to the disambiguating region, with difficulty due to semantic persistence occurring later.

abstract = {Experimental research shows that human sentence processing uses information from different levels of linguistic analysis, for example, lexical and syntactic preferences as well as semantic plausibility. Existing computational models of human sentence processing, however, have focused primarily on lexico-syntactic factors. Those models that do account for semantic plausibility effects lack a general model of human plausibility intuitions at the sentence level. Within a probabilistic framework, we propose a wide-coverage model that both assigns thematic roles to verb-argument pairs and determines a preferred interpretation by evaluating the plausibility of the resulting (verb, role, argument) triples. The model is trained on a corpus of role-annotated language data. We also present a transparent integration of the semantic model with an incremental probabilistic parser. We demonstrate that both the semantic plausibility model and the combined syntax/semantics model predict judgment and reading time data from the experimental literature.},

abstract = {Eye movements of Chinese readers were monitored as they read sentences containing a critical character that was either a 1-character word or the initial character of a 2-character word. Due to manipulation of the verb prior to the target word, the 1-character target word (or the first character of the 2-character target word) was either plausible or implausible, as an independent word, at the point at which it appeared, whereas the 2-character word was always plausible. The eye movement data showed that the plausibility manipulation did not exert an influence on the reading of the 2-character word or its component characters. However, plausibility significantly influenced reading of the 1-character target word. These results suggest that processes of semantic integration in reading Chinese are performed at a word level, instead of a character level, and that word segmentation must take place very early in the course of processing.},

These particular models are reviewed because they provide comprehensive accounts of a large number of empirical findings in each of their respective domains, and because they have advanced our understanding of the cognitive processes involved in reading by motivating new empirical studies. Future models of reading will build upon the success of their predecessors by integrating models from two or more of the aforementioned domains, thereby providing a means to examine the compatibility of their theoretical assumptions and more comprehensive accounts of the cognitive processes involved in reading.},

abstract = { This paper investigates factors which contribute to the complexity of English sentences with long-distance dependencies. Two hypotheses were compared: (1) increased referential processing between the endpoints of a dependency increases processing difficulty at the completion of the dependency (Gibson, 1998, 2000; Warren {\&} Gibson, 2002) and (2) increased similarity between NPs awaiting role-assignment increases memory interference during retrieval (Gordon, Hendrick, {\&} Johnson, 2001). Self-paced word-by-word moving-window reading times were gathered over object-extracted cleft sentences in which two NPs were varied among definite descriptions, first names, and pronouns. Reading times at the verb supported both hypotheses. As the referential hypothesis predicted, reading times were faster when the intervening subject NP had a more referentially accessible type. Consistent with the similarity hypothesis, reading times were slow when both NPs were names or descriptions. Later comprehension measures showed strong effects of similarity-based interference, but did not show effects of referential processing load. },

abstract = {This paper investigates mechanisms of long-distance dependency formation in language comprehension, using experimental data on the processing of Japanese interrogatives and exclamatives to explore the nature of locality biases in parsing. Findings on the processing of exclamative wh-phrases are compared to previous results involving the processing of interrogative wh-phrases, revealing both similarities and differences. Experiment 1 uses a sentence fragment completion task with in-situ and fronted excla-mative and interrogative wh-phrases. Both types of in-situ wh-phrase show a strong bias for local generation of licensing particles. Conditions with fronted wh-phrases show a contrast between interrogative and exclamative wh-phrases: interrogatives show a bias for interpretation in an embedded clause, replicating previous evidence for a long-distance scrambling bias in Japanese (Aoshima, Phillips, {\&} Weinberg, 2004); in contrast , the long-distance scrambling bias is weaker for fronted exclamative wh-phrases. Experiment 2 uses an on-line self-paced reading task to investigate the processing consequences of expectations for a local licensor for in-situ exclamative wh-phrases. Results indicate processing disruption when readers fail to encounter a licensor for an exclama-tive wh-phrase at the first possible verb position, although the disruption is weaker than the Typing Mismatch Effect shown for interrogatives in previous studies by Miyamoto and Takahashi (2002). Different possible accounts of the parallels and contrasts between processing of interrogatives and exclamatives are discussed.},

We outline three possible models to account for the shallow processing of ambiguous pronouns. Two involve an initial commitment followed by possible revision, and the other involves a delay in interpretation. In Experiment 2 we provide evidence that supports the delayed model of ambiguous pronoun resolution under shallow processing. We found no evidence to support a processing system that makes an initial commitment to an interpretation of the pronoun when it is encountered. We extend the account of pronoun resolution proposed by Rigalleau, Caplan, and Baudiffier (2004) to include the treatment of ambiguous pronouns under shallow processing.},

The secondary task was a 2AFC discrimination task in which a discrimination target (DT) ('E' or '3') was presented among distractors, either at the saccade goal, or at a spatially separate, precued location. In the first experiment, the position of the DT was kept constant within an experimental block, while the saccade target location varied. In the second experiment, the location of the DT was varied while the saccade target remained the same within a block. The data demonstrate that attentional dynamics differs between the experiments--attention can shift to the saccade goal early or late during the saccade preparation period, depending on the task. Immediately before saccade onset, however, discrimination performance at the location of the saccade target is always superior to other locations, arguing for a strict and selective coupling between saccade preparation and attention.},

abstract = {Interference is a major source of short-term errors of memory. The present investigation explores the relationship between two important forms of interference: proactive interference (PI), induced by the need to reject recently studied items no longer relevant to task performance, and semantic interference (SI), induced by the need to reject lures sharing a meaningful relationship with current memoranda. We explore the possibility that shared cognitive control processes are recruited to resolve both forms of interference. In Experiment 1, we find that the requirement to engage in articulatory suppression during the retention interval of tasks that induce either PI or SI increases both forms of interference similarly and selectively. In Experiment 2, we develop a task to examine PI and SI within the same experimental context. The results show interactive effects between factors that lead to the two forms of interference. Taken together, these findings support contextual-cuing models of short-term remembering (Nairne, Annual Review of Psychology, 53, 53-81 2002), where the context in which retrieval occurs can influence susceptibility to interference. Lastly, we discuss several theoretical hypotheses concerning the cognitive control processes that are recruited to resolve SI and PI in short-term remembering.},

abstract = {We investigate the extent to which syntactic choice in written English is influenced by processing considerations as predicted by Gibson's (2000) Dependency Locality Theory (DLT) and Surprisal Theory (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008). A long line of previous work attests that languages display a tendency for shorter dependencies, and in a previous corpus study, Temperley (2007) provided evidence that this tendency exerts a strong influence on constituent ordering choices. However, Temperley's study included no frequency-based controls, and subsequent work on sentence comprehension with broad-coverage eye-tracking corpora found weak or negative effects of DLT-based measures when frequency effects were statistically controlled for (Demberg {\&} Keller, 2008; van Schijndel, Nguyen, {\&} Schuler 2013; van Schijndel {\&} Schuler, 2013), calling into question the actual impact of dependency locality on syntactic choice phenomena. Going beyond Temperley's work, we show that DLT integration costs are indeed a significant predictor of syntactic choice in written English even in the presence of competing frequency-based and cognitively motivated control factors, including n-gram probability and PCFG surprisal as well as embedding depth (Wu, Bachrach, Cardenas, {\&} Schuler, 2010; Yngve, 1960). Our study also shows that the predictions of dependency length and surprisal are only moderately correlated, a finding which mirrors Dember {\&} Keller's (2008) results for sentence comprehension. Further, we demonstrate that the efficacy of dependency length in predicting the corpus choice increases with increasing head-dependent distances. At the same time, we find that the tendency towards dependency locality is not always observed, and with pre-verbal adjuncts in particular, non-locality cases are found more often than not. In contrast, surprisal is effective in these cases, and the embedding depth measures further increase prediction accuracy. We discuss the implications of our findings for theories of language comprehension and production, and conclude with a discussion of questions our work raises for future research.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to formalize the generalization criterion method for model comparison. The method has the potential to provide powerful comparisons of complex and nonnested models that may also differ in terms of numbers of parameters. The generalization criterion differs from the better known cross-validation criterion in the following critical procedure. Although both employ a calibration stage to estimate parameters, cross-validation employs a replication sample from the same design for the validation stage, whereas generalization employs a new design for the critical stage. Two examples of the generalization criterion method are presented that demonstrate its usefulness for selecting a model based on sound scientific principles out of a set that also contains models lacking sound scientific principles that are either overly complex or oversimplified. The main advantage of the generalization criterion is its reliance on extrapolations to new conditions. After all, accurate a priori predictions to new conditions are the hallmark of a good scientific theory. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Sentence processing theories typically assume that the input to our language processing mechanisms is an error-free sequence of words. However, this assumption is an oversimplification because noise is present in typical language use (for instance, due to a noisy environment, producer errors, or perceiver errors). A complete theory of human sentence comprehension therefore needs to explain how humans understand language given imperfect input. Indeed, like many cognitive systems, language processing mechanisms may even be "well designed"--in this case for the task of recovering intended meaning from noisy utterances. In particular, comprehension mechanisms may be sensitive to the types of information that an idealized statistical comprehender would be sensitive to. Here, we evaluate four predictions about such a rational (Bayesian) noisy-channel language comprehender in a sentence comprehension task: (i) semantic cues should pull sentence interpretation towards plausible meanings, especially if the wording of the more plausible meaning is close to the observed utterance in terms of the number of edits; (ii) this process should asymmetrically treat insertions and deletions due to the Bayesian "size principle"; such nonliteral interpretation of sentences should (iii) increase with the perceived noise rate of the communicative situation and (iv) decrease if semantically anomalous meanings are more likely to be communicated. These predictions are borne out, strongly suggesting that human language relies on rational statistical inference over a noisy channel.},

abstract = {The notion that prediction is a fundamental principle of human information processing has been en vogue over recent years. The investigation of language processing may be particularly illuminating for testing this claim. Linguists traditionally have argued prediction plays only a minor role during language understanding because of the vast possibilities available to the language user as each word is encountered. In the present review I consider four central questions of anticipatory language processing: Why (i.e. what is the function of prediction in language processing)? What (i.e. what are the cues used to predict up-coming linguistic information and what type of representations are predicted)? How (what mechanisms are involved in predictive language processing and what is the role of possible mediating factors such as working memory)? When (i.e. do individuals always predict up-coming input during language processing)? I propose that prediction occurs via a set of diverse PACS (production-, association-, combinatorial-, and simulation-based prediction) mechanisms which are minimally required for a comprehensive account of predictive language processing. Models of anticipatory language processing must be revised to take multiple mechanisms, mediating factors, and situational context into account. Finally, I conjecture that the evidence considered here is consistent with the notion that prediction is an important aspect but not a fundamental principle of language processing.

However, eye movement evidence suggests that this processing difficulty may occur on only a subset of trials. To investigate this issue, here we fit the ex-Gaussian distribution to naming latencies. The presence of a TL neighbor affected the $\tau$ parameter of the distribution of latencies, but there was no effect on the $\mu$ parameter. Vincentile plots confirmed that only slow responses were affected by the presence of a TL neighbor. These results contrast with the distributional effects of other variables on naming latency and are interpreted as suggesting that the TL effect involves inhibition of an incorrect output rather than broader competition between lexical entries.

abstract = {Time underlies many interesting human behaviors. Thus, the question of how to represent time in connectionist models is very important. One approach is to represent time implicitly by its effects on processing rather than explicitly (as in a spatial representation). The current report develops a proposal along these lines first described by [Jordan, 1986] which involves the use of recurrent links in order to provide networks with a dynamic memory. In this approach, hidden unit patterns are fed back to themselves; the internal representations which develop thus reflect task demands in the context of prior internal states. A set of simulations is reported which range from relatively simple problems (temporal version of XOR) to discovering syntactic/semantic features for words. The networks are able to learn interesting internal representations which incorporate task demands with memory demands; indeed, in this approach the notion of memory is inextricably bound up with task processing. These representations reveal a rich structure, which allows them to be highly context-dependent, while also expressing generalizations across classes of items. These representations suggest a method for representing lexical categories and the type/token distinction.},

abstract = {The diffusion model developed by R. Ratcliff (1978, 1981, 1985, 1988) for 2-choice decisions was applied to data from 2 letter identification experiments. In the experiments, stimulus letters were displayed and then masked, and the stimulus onset asynchrony between letter and mask was manipulated to vary accuracy from near chance to near ceiling. A standard reaction time procedure was used in one experiment and a deadline procedure in the other. Two hypotheses about the effect of masking on the information provided to the decision process were contrasted: (a) The output of perception to the decision process varies with time, so that the information used by the decision process rises and falls, reflecting the stimulus onset and mask onset. (b) The output of perception to the decision is constant over time, reflecting information integrated over the time between the stimulus and mask onsets. The data were well fit by the diffusion model only with the assumption of constant information over time.},

abstract = {An important question in research on eye movements in reading is whether word frequency and word predictability have additive or interactive effects on fixation durations. A fair number of studies have reported only additive effects of the frequency and predictability of a target word on reading times on that word, failing to show significant interactions. Recently, however, Hand, Miellet, O'Donnell, and Sereno (see record 2010-19099-001) reported interactive effects in a study that included the distance of the prior fixation from the target word (launch site). They reported that when the saccade into the target word was launched from very near to the word (within 3 characters), the predictability effect was larger for low frequency words, but when the saccade was launched from a medium distance (4-6 characters from the word) the predictability effect was larger for high frequency words. Hand et al. argued for the importance of including launch site in analyses of target word fixation durations. Here we describe several problems with Hand et al.'s use of analyses of variance in which launch site is divided into distinct ordinal levels. We describe a more appropriate way to analyze such data-linear mixed-effect models-and we use this method to show that launch site does not modulate the interaction between frequency and predictability in two other data sets.},

Norming studies and a priming experiment provide evidence that this result is unlikely to have arisen from direct linguistic associations between patient and agent, suggesting that comprehenders use their event knowledge to form expectations.},

activation changes of brain areas while subjects viewed apparent

cortical areas MT (V5) and MST were the first areas of the 'dorsal'
processing stream which responded with a clear increase in signal
intensity to apparent motion stimuli as compared with flickering
control conditions. Apparent motion of figures defined by illusory
contours evoked greater activation in V2 and MT/MST than appropriate
control conditions. Several areas of the dorsal pathway (V3A, MT/MST,
areas in the inferior and superior parietal lobule) as well as prefrontal
areas including FEF and BA 9/46 responded strongly when subjects
merely imagined moving stimuli which they had seen several seconds
before. The activation during motion imagery increased with the synaptic
distance of an area from V1 along the dorsal processing stream. Area
MT/MST was selectively activated during motion imagery but not during
a static imagery control condition. The comparison between the results
obtained with objective motion, apparent motion and imagined motion

@article{Ratko-Dehnert2013,
abstract = {Mental chronometry is a classical paradigm in cognitive psychology that uses response time and accuracy data in perceptual-motor tasks to elucidate the architecture and mechanisms of the underlying cognitive processes of human decisions. The redundant signals paradigm investigates the response behavior in Experimental tasks, where an integration of signals is required for a successful performance. The common finding is that responses are speeded for the redundant signals condition compared to single signals conditions. On a mean level, this redundant signals effect can be accounted for by several cognitive architectures, exhibiting considerable model mimicry. Jeff Miller formalized the maximum speed-up explainable by separate activations or race models in form of a distributional bound ? the race model inequality. Whenever data violates this bound, it excludes race models as a viable account for the redundant signals effect. The common alternative is a coactivation account, where the signals integrate at some stage in the processing. Coactivation models have mostly been inferred on and rarely explicated though. Where coactivation is explicitly modeled, it is assumed to have a decisional locus. However, in the literature there are indications that coactivation might have at least a partial locus (if not entirely) in the nondecisional or motor stage. There are no studies that have tried to compare the fit of these coactivation variants to empirical data to test different effect generating loci. Ever since its formulation, the race model inequality has been used as a test to infer the cognitive architecture for observers? performance in redundant signals Experiments. Subsequent theoretical and empirical analyses of this RMI test revealed several challenges. On the one hand, it is considered to be a conservative test, as it compares data to the maximum speed-up possible by a race model account. Moreover, simulation studies could show that the base time component can further reduce the power of the test, as violations are filtered out when this component has a high variance. On the other hand, another simulation study revealed that the common practice of RMI test can introduce an estimation bias, that effectively facilitates violations and increases the type I error of the test. Also, as the RMI bound is usually tested at multiple points of the same data, an inflation of type I errors can reach a substantial amount. Due to the lack of overlap in scope and the usage of atheoretic, descriptive reaction time models, the degree to which these results can be generalized is limited. State-of-the-art models of decision making provide a means to overcome these limitations and implement both race and coactivation models in order to perform large scale simulation studies. By applying a state-of-the-art model of decision making (scilicet the Ratcliff diffusion model) to the investigation of the redundant signals effect, the present study addresses research questions at different levels. On a conceptual level, it raises the question, at what stage coactivation occurs ? at a decisional, a nondecisional or a combined decisional and nondecisional processing stage and to what extend? To that end, two bimodal detection tasks have been conducted. As the reaction time data exhibits violations of the RMI at multiple time points, it provides the basis for a comparative fitting analysis of coactivation model variants, representing different loci of the effect. On a test theoretic level, the present study integrates and extends the scopes of previous studies within a coherent simulation framework. The effect of experimental and statistical parameters on the performance of the RMI test (in terms of type I errors, power rates and biases) is analyzed via Monte Carlo simulations. Specifically, the simulations treated the following questions: (i) what is the power of the RMI test, (ii) is there an estimation bias for coactivated data as well and if so, in what direction, (iii) what is the effect of a highly varying base time component on the estimation bias, type I errors and power rates, (iv) and are the results of previous simulation studies (at least qualitatively) replicable, when current models of decision making are used for the reaction time generation. For this purpose, the Ratcliff diffusion model was used to implement race models with controllable amount of correlation and coactivation models with varying integration strength, and independently specifying the base time component. The results of the fitting suggest that for the two bimodal detection tasks, coactivation has a shared decisional and nondecisional locus. For the focused attention experiment the decisional part prevails, whereas in the divided attention task the motor component is dominating the redundant signals effect. The simulation study could reaffirm the conservativeness of the RMI test as latent coactivation is frequently missed. An estimation bias was found also for coactivated data however, both biases become negligible once more than 10 samples per condition are taken to estimate the respective distribution functions. A highly varying base time component reduces both the type I errors and the power of the test, while not affecting the estimation biases. The outcome of the present study has theoretical and practical implications for the investigations of decisions in a multisignal context. Theoretically, it contributes to the locus question of coactivation and offers evidence for a combined decisional and nondecisional coactivation account. On a practical level, the modular simulation approach developed in the present study enables researchers to further investigate the RMI test within a coherent and theoretically grounded framework. It effectively provides a means to optimally set up the RMI test and thus helps to solidify and substantiate its outcomes. On a conceptual level the present study advocates the application of current formal models of decision making to the mental chronometry paradigm and develops future research questions in the field of the redundant signals paradigm.},

On the one hand, studies of reading time and eye tracking suggest that reduced expressions, such as the pronoun he, serve as critical links to integrate separate utterances into a coherent model of discourse. On the other hand, probe-word recognition studies indicate that full anaphoric expressions, such as a repeated name, are more readily interpreted than reduced expressions due to their rich lexical information, which provides effective cues to match the representation of the appropriate referent in memory. The results indicate that the ease of integrating the critical referent into a model of discourse is a function of the congruence of lexical, semantic, and discourse features conveyed by a syntactically prominent reduced expression within linguistic input. This pattern supports the view that a reduced expression is interpreted on-line and indeed plays a critical role in promoting discourse coherence by facilitating the semantic integration of separate utterances.},

abstract = {Psycholinguistic research spanning a number of decades has produced diverging results with regard to the nature of constraint integration in online sentence processing. For example, evidence that language users anticipatorily fixate likely upcoming referents in advance of evidence in the speech signal supports rapid context integration. By contrast, evidence that language users activate representations that conflict with contextual constraints, or only indirectly satisfy them, supports nonintegration or late integration. Here we report on a self-organizing neural network framework that addresses 1 aspect of constraint integration: the integration of incoming lexical information (i.e., an incoming word) with sentence context information (i.e., from preceding words in an unfolding utterance). In 2 simulations, we show that the framework predicts both classic results concerned with lexical ambiguity resolution (Swinney, 1979; Tanenhaus, Leiman, {\&} Seidenberg, 1979), which suggest late context integration, and results demonstrating anticipatory eye movements (e.g., Altmann {\&} Kamide, 1999), which support rapid context integration. We also report 2 experiments using the visual world paradigm that confirm a new prediction of the framework. Listeners heard sentences like "The boy will eat the white {\ldots}" while viewing visual displays with objects like a white cake (i.e., a predictable direct object of "eat"), white car (i.e., an object not predicted by "eat," but consistent with "white"), and distractors. In line with our simulation predictions, we found that while listeners fixated white cake most, they also fixated white car more than unrelated distractors in this highly constraining sentence (and visual) context.},

abstract = {Many models of divided attention assume that signals presented on different channels produce separate activations, any one of which can initiate a response. According to these models, detection responses are especially fast when signals are presented on two channels at the same time because the system can detect a signal in either of two ways. Such models predict a testable relation among reaction time distributions for conditions in which a single signal is presented as compared with a condition in which two signals are presented, and this prediction is tested in two tasks. A bimodal detection task required a simple speeded response to either a visual or an auditory signal. A letter search task required a choice response depending on whether or not a two-letter display included the signal letter"A." Data from both tasks are inconsistent with the prediction. When two signals are presented, responses are faster than separate-activation models can explain. The results favor "coactivation" models, in which signals presented on different channels contribute to a common pool of activation that initiates a response.},

abstract = {When participants are presented simultaneously with spoken language and a visual display depicting objects to which that language refers, participants spontaneously fixate the visual referents of the words being heard [Cooper, R. M. (1974). The control of eye fixation by the meaning of spoken language: A new methodology for the real-time investigation of speech perception, memory, and language processing. Cognitive Psychology, 6(1), 84-107; ]. We demonstrate here that such spontaneous fixation can be driven by partial semantic overlap between a word and a visual object. Participants heard the word 'piano' when (a) a piano was depicted amongst unrelated distractors; (b) a trumpet was depicted amongst those same distractors; and (c), both the piano and trumpet were depicted. The probability of fixating the piano and the trumpet in the first two conditions rose as the word 'piano' unfolded. In the final condition, only fixations to the piano rose, although the trumpet was fixated more than the distractors. We conclude that eye movements are driven by the degree of match, along various dimensions that go beyond simple visual form, between a word and the mental representations of objects in the concurrent visual field.},

abstract = {Language processing requires us to integrate incoming linguistic representations with representations of past input, often across intervening words and phrases. This computational situation has been argued to require retrieval of the appropriate representations from memory via a set of features or representations serving as retrieval cues. However, even within in a cue-based retrieval account of language comprehension, both the structure of retrieval cues and the particular computation that underlies direct-access retrieval are still underspecified. Evidence from two event-related brain potential (ERP) experiments that show cue-based interference from different types of linguistic representations during ellipsis comprehension are consistent with an architecture wherein different cue types are integrated, and where the interaction of cue with the recent contents of memory determines processing outcome, including expression of the interference effect in ERP componentry. I conclude that retrieval likely includes a computation where cues are integrated with the contents of memory via a linear weighting scheme, and I propose vector addition as a candidate formalization of this computation. I attempt to account for these effects and other related phenomena within a broader cue-based framework of language processing.},

abstract = {Probabilistic expectations and memory limitations are central factors governing the real-time comprehension of natural language, but how the two factors interact remains poorly understood. One respect in which the two factors have come into theoretical conflict is the documentation of both locality effects, in which having more dependents preceding a governing verb increases processing difficulty at the verb, and anti-locality effects, in which having more preceding dependents facilitates processing at the verb. However, no controlled study has previously demonstrated both locality and anti-locality effects in the same type of dependency relation within the same language. Additionally, many previous demonstrations of anti-locality effects have been potentially confounded with lexical identity, plausibility, and sentence position. Here, we provide new evidence of both locality and anti-locality effects in the same type of dependency relation in a single language-verb-final constructions in German-while controlling for lexical identity, plausibility, and sentence position. In main clauses, we find clear anti-locality effects, with the presence of a preceding dative argument facilitating processing at the final verb; in subject-extracted relative clauses with identical linear ordering of verbal dependents, we find both anti-locality and locality effects, with processing facilitated when the verb is preceded by a dative argument alone, but hindered when the verb is preceded by both the dative argument and an adjunct. These results indicate that both expectations and memory limitations need to be accounted for in any complete theory of online syntactic comprehension. ?? 2012 Roger P. Levy and Frank Keller.},

Many studies have found experimental effects on the time between the signal and LRP onset, but few have found effects on the time between LRP onset and RT (LRP-RT interval). The primary goal of this study was to produce an effect on the LRP-RT interval. We employed precuing, a manipulation likely to influence motor-programming processes at the end of the RT interval. Subjects performed a 4-alternative choice-RT task in which a signal prompted a button-press with the index or middle finger on the left or right hand. Precues preceded the signals and were either informative, reducing the set of response alternatives from four to two, or uninformative. Besides RT and LRP, we also measured electromyographic (EMG) activity and the P300 ERP component. RT, P300 latency, and the interval between the signal and LRP onset were all shorter with informative than uninformative precues, but the timing of EMG activity relative to RT remained the same. Most importantly, precuing affected the LRP-RT interval. Implications for bisecting RT with LRPs and the identity of processes affected by precuing are discussed. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {The context in which a decision occurs can influence the decision-making process in many ways. In the laboratory, this is often evident in the effects of recent decisions. For instance, many experiments combine easy and difficult decisions, such as when word frequency is manipulated in lexical decision. The "blocking effect" describes how such decisions differ depending on whether the conditions are presented in pure blocks (comprised purely of easy or hard stimuli) or mixed blocks (also known as a "mixing cost"). We present a novel extension to these context effects, demonstrating in two experiments that they can be induced using conditions with identical difficulty, but different timing properties. This suggests that explanations of context effects based on task difficulty or error monitoring alone might be insufficient, and suggest a role for decision time. In prior work, we suggested such a hypothesis under the assumption that observers minimize their decision time, subject to an accuracy constraint. Consistent with this explanation, we find that decisions in slower conditions were based on less evidence when they were experienced in mixed compared to pure blocks.},

abstract = {Meng and Bader (2000b) have shown that for garden-path repair in German, case is a more effective cue than number. They argue that sensitivity to the nature of the cue supports a diagnosis model of garden path repair such as we have proposed. However, in making this argument Meng and Bader introduced a new notion of diagnosis. Retaining the original "basic" diagnosis system, they added a new function that we call triage. Triage determines the probable revisability of a structure, in order to decide whether to make the effort of trying to reanalyze it. To determine whether triage is a feature of human parsing, its scope must be established. We compare four hypotheses about how much work triage could do. A powerful triage component would succeed where the human parser fails. Limited local triage does no work if symptom effectiveness varies within a language. An intermediate hypothesis discriminates better between easy and difficult revisions. However, this variant of triage with the strongest claim to psychological reality is the most difficult to distinguish from no triage at all, since it shares important properties with basic diagnosis. We identify some empirical predictions that differentiate diagnosis with triage from simple basic diagnosis. What little evidence there is at present suggests that the human sentence parser has no triage capability.},

abstract = {This article reviews studies that have used experimental methods from psycholinguistics to address questions about the representa-tion of sentences involving ellipsis. Accounts of the structure of ellipsis can be classified based on three choice points in a decision tree. First: does the identity constraint between antecedents and ellipsis sites apply to syntactic or semantic representations? Second: does the ellipsis site contain a phonologically null copy of the structure of the antecedent, or does it contain a pronoun or pointer that lacks internal structure? Third: if there is unpronounced structure at the ellipsis site, does that structure participate in all syntactic processes, or does it behave as if it is genuinely absent at some levels of syntactic representation? Experimental studies on ellipsis have begun to address the first two of these questions, but they are unlikely to provide insights on the third question, since the theoretical contrasts do not clearly map onto timing predictions. Some of the findings that are emerging in studies on ellipsis resemble findings from earlier studies on other syntactic dependencies involving wh-movement or anaphora. Care should be taken to avoid drawing conclusions from experiments about ellipsis that are known to be unwarranted in experiments about these other dependencies.},

To Whom It May Concern,




This letter confirms my support for Prof. Dr. Seyhun Topbas' plan to establish the Special Needs People Center of Excellence.




Over the past decades, considerable progress has been made in understanding the nature of the processes involved in language comprehension through the use of advanced research methods, such as fMRI, EEG, and eye-tracking. In this process, many new questions have come up, that have not yet been satisfactorily answered. One attractive way to solve these problems is by extending the scope of psycholinguistic research to languages like Turkish, which have a radically different grammar. Investigation into Turkish speakers' moment-by-moment understanding of language will not only significantly widen our knowledge of language comprehension processes, but also of cognitive processes in general. To this end Prof. Dr. Seyhun Topbas and I have established a collaboration, in which we aim at addressing several unsolved the key phenomena that make T

In the past few years, advances in this research area have been obtained at an ever-accelerating pace. This increase is due in part to the combination of sentence-level parsing models with traditional mathematical models of fixation behavior. These integrated models have deepened our understanding while at the same time highlighted new questions about the role linguistic structure plays in conditioning eye movements.
The only way to address these exciting new questions is to carefully collect eye movement data from subjects who natively use the linguistic structures we have not yet studied. Professor Vasishth's project does this by examining Hindi in way that is rigorously informed by the latest computational and statistical methods.
I therefore look forward to helping Vasishth and his European colleagues with this project. My students and I will provide the software and expertise required to adapt the proposed incremental parsing models to Hindi. We expect to hold frequent video-conferences and look forward to Professor Vasishth coming to Cornell to speak about the results.},

abstract = {In the literature dealing with the reanalysis of garden path sentences such as While the man hunted the deer ran into the woods, it is generally assumed either that people completely repair their initial incorrect syntactic representations to yield a final interpretation whose syntactic structure is fully consistent with the input string or that the parse fails. In a series of five experiments, we explored the possibility that partial reanalyses take place. Specifically, we examined the conditions under which part of the initial incorrect analysis persists at the same time that part of the correct final analysis is constructed. In Experiments 1a and 1b, we found that both the length of the ambiguous region and the plausibility of the ultimate interpretation affected the likelihood that such sentences would be fully reanalyzed. In Experiment 2, we compared garden path sentences with non-garden path sentences and com-pared performance on two different types of comprehension questions. In Experi-ments 3a and 3b, we constructed garden path sentences using a small class of syntac-tically unique verbs to provide converging evidence against the position that people employ some sort of ''general reasoning'' or pragmatic inference when faced with syntactically difficult garden paths. The results from these experiments indicate that reanalysis of such sentences is not always complete, so that comprehenders often derive an interpretation for the full sentence in which part of the initial misanalysis persists. We conclude that the goal of language processing is not always to create an idealized structure, but rather to create a representation that is ''good enough'' to satisfy the comprehender that an appropriate interpretation has been obtained.},

abstract = {The cue-based retrieval theory (Lewis, Vasishth, {\&} Van Dyke, 2006) predicts that interference from similar distractors should create difficulty for argument integration, however this hypothesis has only been examined in the written modality. The current study uses the Visual World Paradigm (VWP) to assess its feasibility to study retrieval interference arising from distractors present in a visual display during spoken language comprehension. The study aims to extend findings from Van Dyke {\&} McElree (2006), which utilized a dual-task paradigm with written sentences in which they manipulated the relationship between extra-sentential distractors and the semantic retrieval cues from a verb, to the spoken modality. Results indicate that retrieval interference effects do occur in the spoken modality, manifesting immediately upon encountering the verbal retrieval cue for inaccurate trials when the distractors are present in the visual field. We also observed indicators of repair processes in trials containing semantic distractors, which were ultimately answered correctly. We conclude that the VWP is a useful tool for investigating retrieval interference effects, including both the online effects of distractors and their after-effects, when repair is initiated. This work paves the way for further studies of retrieval interference in the spoken modality, which is especially significant for examining the phenomenon in pre-reading children, non-reading adults (e.g., people with aphasia), and spoken language bilinguals.},

abstract = {Research on shallow processing suggests that readers sometimes encode only a superficial representation of a text and fail to make use of all available information. Greene, McKoon, and Ratcliff (1992) extended this work to pronouns, finding evidence that readers sometimes fail to automatically identify referents even when these are unambiguous. In this paper we revisit those findings. In 11 recognition probe, priming, and self-report experiments, we manipulated Greene et al.'s stories to discover under what circumstances a pronoun's referent is automatically understood. We lengthened the stories from 4 to 8 lines. This simple manipulation led to automatic and correct resolution, which we attribute to readers' increased engagement with the stories. We found evidence of resolution even when the additional text did not mention the pronoun's referent. In addition, our results suggest that the pronoun temporarily boosts the referent's accessibility, an advantage that disappears by the end of the next sentence. Finally, we present evidence from memory experiments that supports complete pronoun resolution for the longer but not the shorter stories.

it spreads out the unit mass of prior probability), the more the
null is favored. A general solution is a sensitivity analysis: Compute
the odds for or against the null as a function of the limit(s) on
the vagueness of the alternative. If the odds on the null approach
1 from above as the hypothesized maximum size of the possible effect

of the analysis are illustrated by the analysis of diverse examples

abstract = {In 3 experiments, the author examined how readers' eye movements are influenced by joint manipulations of a word's frequency and the syntactic fit of the word in its context. In the critical conditions of the first 2 experiments, a high- or low-frequency verb was used to disambiguate a garden-path sentence, while in the last experiment, a high- or low-frequency verb constituted a phrase structure violation. The frequency manipulation always influenced the early eye movement measures of first-fixation duration and gaze duration. The context manipulation had a delayed effect in Experiment 1, influencing only the probability of a regressive eye movement from later in the sentence. However, the context manipulation influenced the same early eye movement measures as the frequency effect in Experiments 2 and 3, though there was no statistical interaction between the effects of these variables. The context manipulation also influenced the probability of a regressive eye movement from the verb, though the frequency manipulation did not. These results are shown to confirm predictions emerging from the serial, staged architecture for lexical and integrative processing of the E–Z Reader 10 model of eye movement control in reading (Reichle, Warren, {\&} McConnell, 2009). It is argued, more generally, that the results provide an important constraint on how the relationship between visual word recognition and syntactic attachment is treated in processing models.},

Participants encoded 6 letters for serial recall; each letter was preceded and followed by a processing period comprising 4 trials of difficult visual search. Processing duration, during which memory could decay, was manipulated via search set size. This manipulation increased retention interval by up to 100{\%} without having any effect on recall accuracy. This result held with and without articulatory suppression. Two experiments using a dual-task paradigm showed that the visual search process required central attention. Thus, even when memory maintenance by central attention and by articulatory rehearsal was prevented, a large delay had no effect on memory performance, contrary to the decay notion. Most previous experiments that manipulated the retention interval and the opportunity for maintenance processes in complex span have confounded these variables with time pressure during processing periods. Three further experiments identified time pressure as the variable that affected recall. We conclude that time-based decay does not contribute to the capacity limit of verbal working memory.},

Current semantic processing theories suggest that word meanings are retrieved from diverse cortical regions storing sensory-motor and other types of semantic information and are further integrated with context in left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG). Our fMRI data indicate that brain activity in an area sensitive to motion and action semantics--the posterior middle temporal gyrus (PMTG)--is modulated by a word's syntactic context. Ambiguous words such as bowl were presented in minimal disambiguating contexts indicating object (the bowl) or action (to bowl) meanings and were compared to low-ambiguity controls. Ambiguous words elicited more activity than low-ambiguity controls in LIFG and various meaning-related areas such as PMTG. Critically, ambiguous words also elicited more activity in to--contexts than the--contexts in PMTG and LIFG, suggesting that contextual integration strengthened the action meaning in both areas. The pattern of results suggests that the activation of lexical information in PMTG was sensitive to contextual disambiguating information and that processing context-dependent meanings may involve interactions between frontal and posterior areas.},

Using self-paced reading, we examined how advanced Greek-speaking learners of English and native speaker controls read sentences containing temporary subject–object ambiguities, with the ambiguous noun phrase being either semantically plausible or implausible as the direct object of the immediately preceding verb. Besides providing evidence for incremental interpretation in second language processing, our results indicate that the learners were more strongly influenced by plausibility information than the native speaker controls in their on-line processing of the experimental items. For the second language learners an initially plausible direct object interpretation lead to increased reanalysis difficulty in “weak” garden path sentences where the required reanalysis did not interrupt the current thematic processing domain. No such evidence of on-line recovery was observed, in contrast, for “strong” garden-path sentences that required more substantial revisions of the representation built thus far, suggesting that comprehension breakdown was more likely here.},

abstract = {The goal of the present study is to provide a direct comparison of the results of informal judgment collection methods with the results of formal judgment collection methods, as a first step in understanding the relative merits of each family of methods. Although previous studies have compared small samples of informal and formal results, this article presents the first large-scale comparison based on a random sample of phenomena from a leading theoretical journal (Linguistic Inquiry). We tested 296 data points from the approximately 1743 English data points that were published in Linguistic Inquiry between 2001 and 2010. We tested this sample with 936 na{\"{i}}ve participants using three formal judgment tasks (magnitude estimation, 7-point Likert scale, and two-alternative forced-choice) and report five statistical analyses. The results suggest a convergence rate of 95{\%} between informal and formal methods, with a margin of error of 5.3-5.8{\%}. We discuss the implications of this convergence rate for the ongoing conversation about judgment collection methods, and lay out a set of questions for future research into syntactic methodology. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Linguistic illusions have provided valuable insights into how speakers mentally encode and navigate complex structured representations during real-time language comprehension. A parade case involves illusory licensing of negative polarity items (NPIs) like ever, where comprehenders temporarily accept sentences with an illicit NPI in on-line measures, but later judge those same sentences as unacceptable after more reflection in off-line tasks. Existing accounts of the illusion differ in their views of how NPI licensing obtains, but agree that the illusion reflects a noisy on- line implementation of the licensing mechanism. In contrast, we show across seven experiments (off-line and on-line measures and computational modeling) that the position of the NPI strongly modulates the illusion, which implies that the illusion cannot simply be due to a noisy licensing mechanism. Rather, we suggest that this effect reflects changes over time in how hierarchical representations are encoded in memory. Contrary to the widespread assumption that the format of hierarchical representations remains constant as a parse is extended, we argue that sentence encodings change from a transparent format that is highly susceptible to retrieval interference to a more opaque format that strongly resists interference. This shift in the representational format prevents illusory licensing errors, and hence yields greater processing accuracy. These findings lead to a new conception of how linguistic illusions do and do not arise, in which variable susceptibility to illusions is a consequence of the representational format of hierarchical encodings in memory. In discussion, we relate the current findings to parallel findings from research on feature binding in visual cognition.},

abstract = {One influential hypothesis posits that the brain regions implicated
in Broca's aphasia are responsible for specific syntactic operations
that are necessary for the comprehension and production of sentences
(Grodzinsky, 1986, 1990, in press). The empirical basis of this hypothesis
is the claim that Broca's aphasics have no difficulty understanding
sentences in the active voice (and other "canonical" sentence types,
such as subject relatives and clefts with negative predicates), but
perform at chance level with passive voice constructions (and other
"noncanonical" sentences such as object-gap relatives and object
clefts). In the face of well-established results indicating that
Broca's aphasics can exhibit several different performance patterns
on these sentence types, Grodzinsky, Pi{\{}$\backslash$$\backslash${\~{}}n{\}}ango, Zurif, and Drai
(1999) argued that these conflicting results do not challenge the
theory when the data are analyzed appropriately. They carried out
a creative statistical analysis of the comprehension performance
of published cases of Broca's aphasia and concluded that all of these
cases are in agreement with the predicted pattern: chance on passives
and 100{\%} correct on actives. Here we show that the statistical reasoning
adopted by Grodzinsky et al. (1999) is flawed. We also show that
the comprehension performance of a substantial number of the Broca's
aphasics in their own sample does not conform to the pattern required.
Rather, contrary to these authors' claim, Broca's aphasia is not
associated with a consistent pattern of sentence comprehension performance,
but allows for a number of distinct patterns in different patients.},

Pointer- or “sharing”-based approaches to ellipsis processing (Frazier {\&} Clifton 2001, 2005; Martin {\&} McElree 2008) predict no effect of antecedent complexity on reading times at the ellipsis site while other accounts predict increased antecedent complexity to either slow down processing (Murphy 1985) or to speed it up (Hofmeister 2011). Experiment 1 manipulated antecedent complexity and elision, yielding evidence against a speedup at the ellipsis site and in favor of a null effect. In order to investigate possible superficial processing on part of participants, Experiment 2 manipulated the amount of attention required to correctly respond to end-of-sentence comprehension probes, yielding evidence against a complexity-induced slowdown at the ellipsis site. Overall, our results are compatible with pointer-based approaches while casting doubt on the notion that changes antecedent complexity lead to measurable differences in ellipsis processing speed.},

abstract = {In most languages, most of the syntactic dependency relations found in any given sentence are projective: the word-word dependencies in the sentence do not cross each other. Some syntactic dependency relations, however, are non-projective: some of their word-word dependencies cross each other. Non-projective dependencies are both rarer and more computationally complex than projective dependencies; hence, it is of natural interest to investigate whether there are any processing costs specific to non-projective dependencies, and whether factors known to influence processing of projective dependencies also affect non-projective dependency processing. We report three self-paced reading studies, together with corpus and sentence completion studies, investigating the comprehension difficulty associated with the non-projective dependencies created by the extraposition of relative clauses in English. We find that extraposition over either verbs or prepositional phrases creates comprehension difficulty, and that this difficulty is consistent with probabilistic syntactic expectations estimated from corpora. Furthermore, we find that manipulating the expectation that a given noun will have a postmodifying relative clause can modulate and even neutralize the difficulty associated with extraposition. Our experiments rule out accounts based purely on derivational complexity and/or dependency locality in terms of linear positioning. Our results demonstrate that comprehenders maintain probabilistic syntactic expectations that persist beyond projective-dependency structures, and suggest that it may be possible to explain observed patterns of comprehension difficulty associated with extraposition entirely through probabilistic expectations. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

This large data set allows us to characterize the RT distributions in detail. We present the raw RT distributions and fit several psychologically motivated functions (ex-Gaussian, ex-Wald, Gamma, and Weibull) to the data.

Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the "raw" AIC values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham {\&} Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model comparison procedures.},

abstract = {Cataphoric dependencies where a pronoun precedes its antecedent appear to call on different mechanisms in language comprehension from forward dependencies where the antecedent precedes the pronoun. Previous research has shown that the resolution of cataphoric dependencies involves predictive processes such as the Active Search Mechanism, which hypothesizes the automatic search for an antecedent immediately after encountering a cataphoric pronoun. The current study employs gender mismatch to investigate whether the active search for an antecedent of a cataphoric pronoun is restricted only to grammatically licit positions. We present results from an event-related potential experiment on the reading comprehension of cataphoric dependencies in Dutch. Results show that gender mismatch gives rise to an anterior negativity at grammatically licit antecedent positions only. We hypothesize that this negativity reflects the prediction failure for an antecedent after encountering a pronoun, rather than a gender mismatch. We discuss the timing, topography and functionality of this negativity with respect to previous studies and how this relates to the ERPs elicited in the processing of structural constraints on pronoun resolution.},

Previous work (Boston, Hale, Vasishth, {\&} Kliegl, 2011) has shown that surprisal (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and cue-based memory retrieval (Lewis {\&} Vasishth, 2005) are significant and complementary predictors of reading time in an eyetracking corpus. It remains an open question how the sentence processor interacts with oculomotor control. Using a simple linking hypothesis proposed in Reichle, Warren, and McConnell (2009), we integrated both measures with the eye movement model EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) inside the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004). We built a reading model that could initiate short "Time Out regressions" (Mitchell, Shen, Green, {\&} Hodgson, 2008) that compensate for slow postlexical processing. This simple interaction enabled the model to predict the re-reading of words based on parsing difficulty. The model was evaluated in different configurations on the prediction of frequency effects on the Potsdam Sentence Corpus. The extension of EMMA with postlexical processing improved its predictions and reproduced re-reading rates and durations with a reasonable fit to the data. This demonstration, based on simple and independently motivated assumptions, serves as a foundational step toward a precise investigation of the interaction between high-level language processing and eye movement control.},

Based on this evidence, Cuetos and Mitchell concluded that Late Closure is not a universal principle of the human sentence processing mechanism. In this paper, we provide new evidence from Spanish and English self-paced reading experiments on relative clause attachment ambiguities that involve three possible attachment sites. The results of our experiments suggest that a principle like Late Closure is in fact universally operative in the human parser, but that it is modulated by at least one other factor in the processing of relative clause attachment ambiguities. We propose that the second factor involved in the processing of these and related constructions is the principle of Predicate Proximity, according to which attachments are preferred to be as structurally close to the head of a predicate phrase as possible, and we further consider the origins and predictions of the theory combining these two factors.},

abstract = {While much previous work on reading in languages with alphabetic scripts has suggested that reading is word-based, reading in Chinese has been argued to be less reliant on words. This is primarily because in the Chinese writing system words are not spatially segmented, and characters are themselves complex visual objects. Here, we present a systematic characterization of the effects of a wide range of word and character properties on eye movements in Chinese reading, using a set of mixed-effects regression models. The results reveal a rich pattern of effects of the properties of the current, previous, and next words on a range of reading measures, which is strikingly similar to the pattern of effects of word properties reported in spaced alphabetic languages. This finding provides evidence that reading shares a word-based core and may be fundamentally similar across languages with highly dissimilar scripts. We show that these findings are robust to the inclusion of character properties in the regression models and are equally reliable when dependent measures are defined in terms of characters rather than words, providing strong evidence that word properties have effects in Chinese reading above and beyond characters. This systematic characterization of the effects of word and character properties in Chinese advances our knowledge of the processes underlying reading and informs the future development of models of reading. More generally, however, this work suggests that differences in script may not alter the fundamental nature of reading. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).},

This hypothesis predicts (1) that non-human primates and other animals lack the ability to learn recursive grammar, and (2) that recursive grammar is the sole cognitive mechanism that is unique to human language.

Recent work suggests that the SOV order may be the default in human language. Why, then, is SVO order so common? We hypothesize that SOV/SVO variation can be explained by language users' sensitivity to the possibility of noise corrupting the linguistic signal. In particular, the noisy-channel hypothesis predicts a shift from the default SOV order to SVO order for semantically reversible events, for which potential ambiguity arises in SOV order because two plausible agents appear on the same side of the verb. We found support for this prediction in three languages (English, Japanese, and Korean) by using a gesture-production task, which reflects word-order preferences largely independent of native language. Other patterns of crosslinguistic variation (e.g., the prevalence of case marking in SOV languages and its relative absence in SVO languages) also straightforwardly follow from the noisy-channel hypothesis.},

abstract = {Cognitive control processes associated with long- and short-term adjustments of human behaviour have attracted much interest recently. It is still unclear, however, whether the mechanisms underlying these adjustments share a common locus within the chain of stimulus-response processing. In order to address this issue, the present study employed a speed-accuracy instruction producing a macro-trade-off, whereas micro-trade-off was studied by means of posterror slowing in reaction time (RT). Participants performed a spatially compatible or incompatible four-stimuli-to-two-response alternative choice RT task. Reliable variations in micro-and macro-trade-off as well as effects of spatial compatibility were found in RT and error rate. Most importantly, posterror slowing was larger when instruction stressed accuracy rather than speed, an effect being independent of spatial compatibility. Because the influence of speed-accuracy instruction and posterror slowing on performance was strongest for response alternations, together present findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying micro- and macro-trade-offs have one common locus at the level of motor processing. Additional influences of macro-trade-off on premotoric processing are likely.},

abstract = {Aword's predictability in its context has a reliable inf luence on eye movements in reading. This article reviews the extensive literature that has investigated this inf luence, focusing on several specific empirical issues. These include assessment of cloze probability as the critical measure of predictability, the form of the relationship between predictability and reading time, the distributional effects of predictability, the interaction between predictability and word frequency, and the interaction between predictability and parafoveal preview.On the basis of this review, two theoretical conclusions are proposed. First, predict- ability effects in reading result from graded activation of potentially many words, as opposed to discrete prediction of a specific word. Second, this activation has the effect of facilitating either very early stages of lexical processing or pre-lexical processing of visual features or letters.},

The Pirah{\~{a}} are an Amazonian tribe who have been previously studied for their limited numerical system [Gordon, P. (2004). Numerical cognition without words: Evidence from Amazonia. Science 306, 496-499]. We show that the Pirah{\~{a}} have no linguistic method whatsoever for expressing exact quantity, not even "one." Despite this lack, when retested on the matching tasks used by Gordon, Pirah{\~{a}} speakers were able to perform exact matches with large numbers of objects perfectly but, as previously reported, they were inaccurate on matching tasks involving memory. These results suggest that language for exact number is a cultural invention rather than a linguistic universal, and that number words do not change our underlying representations of number but instead are a cognitive technology for keeping track of the cardinality of large sets across time, space, and changes in modality. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Semantic richness (NOF: number of features) influenced lexical decision reaction times in that semantically rich words (high NOF) were processed faster than semantically impoverished words (low NOF). Processing in the VWP was faster for high NOF words but only when an onset competitor was present in the display (target BREAD, onset competitor BRICK). Adding background speech babble to the spoken stimuli resulted in an advantage for processing high NOF words with and without onset competitors in the display. The results suggest that semantic representations directly contribute to the recognition of spoken words and that sub-optimal listening conditions (e.g., background babble) enhance the role of semantics. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In the field of psychology, the practice of p value null-hypothesis testing is as widespread as ever. Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of the p value procedure. In particular, p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover, p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews these p value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to these p value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specifi- cation of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should
be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude

in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic
fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the
one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal
amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite
number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found
that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum
finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion
used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It
is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter

@article{Pylkkanen2009a,
abstract = {To study the neural bases of semantic composition in language processing without confounds from syntactic composition, recent magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies have investigated the processing of constructions that exhibit some type of syntax-semantics mismatch. The most studied case of such a mismatch is complement coercion; expressions such as the author began the book, where an entity-denoting noun phrase is coerced into an eventive meaning in order to match the semantic properties of the event-selecting verb (e.g., 'the author began reading/writing the book'). These expressions have been found to elicit increased activity in the Anterior Midline Field (AMF), an MEG component elicited at frontomedial sensors at approximately 400 ms after the onset of the coercing noun [Pylkk{\"{a}}nen, L., {\&} McElree, B. (2007). An MEG study of silent meaning. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19, 11]. Thus, the AMF constitutes a potential neural correlate of coercion. However, the AMF was generated in ventromedial prefrontal regions, which are heavily associated with decision-making. This raises the possibility that, instead of semantic processing, the AMF effect may have been related to the experimental task, which was a sensicality judgment. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the effect of coercion when subjects were simply reading for comprehension, without a decision-task. Additionally, we investigated coercion in an adjectival rather than a verbal environment to further generalize the findings. Our results show that an AMF effect of coercion is elicited without a decision-task and that the effect also extends to this novel syntactic environment. We conclude that in addition to its role in non-linguistic higher cognition, ventromedial prefrontal regions contribute to the resolution of syntax-semantics mismatches in language processing.},

abstract = {Recently, themobile telecommunicationmarket in the Netherlands has changed from a rapidly growing market, into a state of saturation and fierce compe- tition. The focus of telecommunication companies has therefore shifted from building a large customer base into keeping customers ‘in house'. Customers who switch to a competitor are so called churned customers. Churn pre- vention, through churn prediction, is one way to keep customers ‘in house'. In this study we focus solely on prepaid customers. In contrast to post- paid customers, prepaid customers are not bound by a contract. The central problem concerning prepaid customers is that the actual churn date in most cases is difficult to assess. This is a direct consequence of the difficulty in providing a unequivocal definition of churning and a lack of understanding in churn behavior. To overcome this problem, here a custom and flexible churn definition is proposed. The predictive churn model presented in this study is based on the the- ory of survival analysis. Survival analysis is predominantly used in medical sciences to examine the influence of variables on the length of survival of patients. In survival analysis, the time until the occurance of a well-defined event is modelled. In the present case, the event of interest is churn. In this research the focus is on the extended Cox model. This is a variant of the original proportional hazards model, that is used for churn modelling. Since survival models are not designed to act as predictive models, some adjustments had to be made. To be able to compare the performance of the extended Cox model with the established predictive models, a decision tree is also considered. Both models performed approximately similar with a sensitivity ranging from 93{\%} to 99{\%} and a specificity ranging from 92{\%} to 97{\%}, depending on the model and the churn definition. The extended Cox model can be considered as a perfect alternative to the established predictive models and offers some unique qualities.},

Functional MRI data show that: (a) a motor region tracks the output of equation solutions, (b) a prefrontal region tracks the retrieval of declarative information, (c) a parietal region tracks the transformation of mental representations of the equation, (d) an anterior cingulate region tracks the setting of goal information to control the information flow, and (e) a caudate region tracks the firing of productions in the ACT-R model.

In conditions where the accessible antecedent mismatched the animacy cue, we found inhibitory interference whereas in antecedent-match conditions, no effect of the distractor was observed. In Experiment 2, we tested only antecedent-match configurations and manipulated locality of the reflexive-antecedent binding (Mandarin allows non-local binding). Participants were asked to hold three distractors (animate vs. inanimate nouns) in memory while reading the target sentence. We found slower reading times when animate distractors were held in memory (inhibitory interference). Moreover, we replicated the locality effect reported in previous studies. These results are incompatible with structure-based accounts. However, the cue-based ACT-R model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005) cannot explain the observed pattern either. We therefore extend the original ACT-R model and show how this model not only explains the data presented in this article, but is also able to account for previously unexplained patterns in the literature on reflexive processing.},

abstract = {Previous work has shown that in English ungrammatical cen- ter embeddings are more acceptable and easier to process than their grammatical counterparts (Frazier, 1985; Gibson {\&} Thomas, 1999). A well-known explanation for this preference for ungrammatical structures is based on working-memory overload: the claim is that the prediction for an upcoming verb phrase is forgotten due to memory overload, leading to an illusion of grammaticality (Gibson {\&} Thomas, 1999). How- ever, this memory-overload account cannot explain the recent finding by Vasishth, Suckow, Lewis, and Kern (2008) that in German no illusion of ungrammaticality occurs. We present a simple recurrent network model that can explain both the pres- ence of the grammaticality illusion in English and its absence in German. We argue that the grammaticality illusion emerges as a function of experience with language-specific structures, not working memory constraints as argued for in Gibson and Thomas (1999).},

We provide an overview of each method and show that a salient difference is the choice of models. The two approaches as commonly practiced can be unified with a certain model specification, now popular in the statistics literature, called spike-and-slab priors. A spike-and-slab prior is a mixture of a null model, the spike, with an effect model, the slab. The estimate of the effect size here is a function of the Bayes factor, showing that estimation and model comparison can be unified. The salient difference is that common Bayes factor approaches provide for privileged consideration of theoretically useful parameter values, such as the value corresponding to the null hypothesis, while estimation approaches do not. Both approaches, either privileging the null or not, are useful depending on the goals of the analyst.},

In this article, we develop a framework and relevant mathematical formulae that represent different capacity assays (Miller's race model bound, Grice's bound, and Townsend's capacity coefficient) in the same space. The new space allows a direct comparison between the distinct bounds and the capacity coefficient values and helps explicate the relationships among the different measures. An analogous common space is proposed for the AND paradigm, relating the capacity index to the Colonius-Vorberg bounds. We illustrate the effectiveness of the unified spaces by presenting data from two simulated models (standard parallel, coactive) and a prototypical visual detection experiment. A conversion table for the unified spaces is provided.},

However, it remains an open question what information they use to determine gap locations. The current study investigates parallelism in coordinate extraction structures, and asks whether comprehenders use parallelism constraints to structure their expectations about upcoming gap sites. Using a filled-gap paradigm, Experiments 1 and 2 show that comprehenders rely on parallelism to restrict the search for upcoming gap sites to specific locations in sentences with coordinate extraction. Experiment 3 shows that this effect cannot be reduced to processing factors, but may be due to a grammatically-based constraint on parallel extraction. Together, these results shed new light on the source and scope of active processing and parallelism effects in comprehension.},

@inproceedings{EngelmannJaegerVasishth:2015,
abstract = {The cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of non-adjacent syntactic dependencies are critical for the un-derstanding of human language processing. For instance, a verb needs to be syntactically and semantically integrated with its subject, or a reflexive like himself needs to be syn-tactically bound by its antecedent before it can be assigned any meaning. Thus, when processing the second part of a syntactic dependency, the parser needs to retrieve the corre-sponding first part of this dependency. The mechanisms un-derlying these syntactically triggered retrieval processes have drawn considerable attention in psycholinguistic research. Lewis and Vasishth (2005) (LV05) developed a model of sentence processing which is based on the general cogni-tive architecture ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004). This model assumes a content-addressable memory in which cue-based retrieval processes are subject to similarity-based interfer-ence from (partially) cue-matching distractors. The LV05 model has widely been used to explain interference effects observed in the processing of syntactic dependencies such as reflexive-antecedent or subject-verb dependencies. Although the model is able to capture some of the empirically observed effects, there is a range of data the model is unable to explain. We propose to extend the LV05 model by two independently motivated assumptions, namely cue confusion and activation-sensitive interference. We demonstrate that this extended model explains a wide range of empirically observed effects the original LV05 model does not account for. The LV05 model predicts that when retrieving the left part of a dependency (the target), a syntactically inaccessible noun phrase (distractor) that overlaps in features with the target noun phrase causes similarity-based interference, which leads to slowed processing (i.e., inhibitory interference). This is predicted, e.g., in the retrieval of a reflexive's antecedent as in (1) in Table 1, where the stereotypical gender on the target surgeon and on the distractor Jonathan both match the gen-der cue on the reflexive. By contrast, in (2), the stereotypical gender of the target surgeon mismatches the gender cue at the reflexive; here, a matching distractor is predicted to speed up processing by luring the parser into erroneous retrievals (fa-cilitatory interference). Both effects are attested (e.g., Pearl-mutter, Garnsey, {\&} Bock, 1999; Badecker {\&} Straub, 2002). However, some studies have found facilitatory interference where inhibition was expected, and vice versa; other studies have failed to find interference effects. We developed a com-putational model extending LV05 by two independently mo-tivated principles that can account for these apparently con-tradictory results. We show this in simulations that reproduce the patterns that were seen in a large-scale literature review.},

Although these evaluations of intuitive relative judgments are valuable, they do not justify the use of nonquantitative linguistic methods. We argue that objectivity is a universal value in science that should be adopted by linguistics. In addition, the reliability measures that S{\&}A report are not sufficient for developing sophisticated linguistic theories. Furthermore, quantitative methods yield two additional benefits: consistency of judgments across many pairs of judgments; and an understanding of the relative effect sizes across sets of judgments. We illustrate these points with an experiment that demonstrates five clear levels of acceptability. Finally, we observe that S{\&}A's experiments—where only two authors evaluated 10 years' worth of journal articles and one standard textbook within a few months—further emphasise one of our critical original points: conducting behavioural experiments is in many respects easy and fast with the advent of online research tools like Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Given the current ease of performing quantitative experiments (using a platform like Mechanical Turk) and the clear limitations of not doing so, linguistic hypotheses should be evaluated quantitatively whenever it is feasible.},

abstract = {Research on language comprehension has focused on the resolution of syntactic ambiguities, and most studies have employed garden-path sentences to determine the system's preferences and to assess its use of nonsyntactic sources information. A topic that has been neglected is how syntactically challenging but essentially unambiguous sentences are processed, including passives and object-clefts--sentences that require thematic roles to be assigned in an atypical order. The three experiments described here tested the idea that sentences are processed both algorithmically and heuristically. Sentences were presented aurally and the participants' task was to identify the thematic roles in the sentence (e.g., Who was the do-er?). The first experiment demonstrates that passives are frequently and systematically misinterpreted, especially when they express implausible ideas. The second shows that the surface frequency of a syntactic form does not determine ease of processing, as active sentences and subject-clefts were comprehended equally easily despite the rareness of the latter type. The third experiment compares the processing of subject- and object-clefts, and the results show that they are similar to actives and passives, respectively, again despite the infrequent occurrence in English of any type of cleft. The results of the three experiments suggest that a comprehensive theory of language comprehension must assume that simple processing heuristics are used during processing in addition to (and perhaps sometimes instead of) syntactic algorithms. Moreover, the experiments support the idea that language processing is often based on shallow processing, yielding a merely "good enough" rather than a detailed linguistic representation of an utterance's meaning.},

In terms of analysis, the newer approach replaces traditional aggregate statistics such as means, variances, and covariances with methods of pattern detection and analysis. While these methods are person-centered and do not require parametric assumptions, they are both demanding and rigorous.

abstract = {This article describes the use of Bayes factors for comparing dynamic causal models (DCMs). DCMs are used to make inferences about effective connectivity from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. These inferences, however, are contingent upon assumptions about model structure, that is, the connectivity pattern between the regions included in the model. Given the current lack of detailed knowledge on anatomical connectivity in the human brain, there are often considerable degrees of freedom when defining the connectional structure of DCMs. In addition, many plausible scientific hypotheses may exist about which connections are changed by experimental manipulation, and a formal procedure for directly comparing these competing hypotheses is highly desirable. In this article, we show how Bayes factors can be used to guide choices about model structure, both concerning the intrinsic connectivity pattern and the contextual modulation of individual connections. The combined use of Bayes factors and DCM thus allows one to evaluate competing scientific theories about the architecture of large-scale neural networks and the neuronal interactions that mediate perception and cognition.},

abstract = {In this dissertation, I look at four distinct systems that all embody a similar challenge to modeling complex scenarios from noisy multidimensional historical data. In many scenarios, it is important to form an opinion, make a prediction, implement a business decision, or make an investment based upon expected future system behavior. All systems embody an amount of uncertainty, and quantify- ing that uncertainty using statistical methods, allows for better decision making. Three distinct scenarios are discussed with novel application of statistical methods to best quantify the endogenous uncertainty and aid in optimal decision making. Two chapters focus on predicting the winners of a horse race, one on predicting movement of a stock index, and the fourth on molding response from an online advertising effort. The first horse racing chapter uses a hierarchical Bayesian approach to model- ing running speed, using a novel grouping of races into "profiles" and then pooling information across those profiles to improve predictive accuracy. The second horse racing chapter implements a novel conditional logistic regression that is modified by frailty parameter derived from winning payoff, and then regularized with a LASSO. High speed parallel algorithms, running on a GPU, were hand coded to optimize tuning LASSO parameters in rapid time. The chapter on stock index prediction explores the application of ensemble filters. I show how an ensemble of filters on individual member stocks is a better predictor of index direction than a filter directly on the index. The chapter on advertising explores how the clicks and sales from an Ad- Words campaign may be modeled with a re-paramaterized Beta distribution to better capture variance. Empirical data from a live campaign is studied, with a hierarchical Bayesian framework for brand features solved using a Metropolis within Gibbs algorithm.},

abstract = {Interference has been identified as a cause of processing difficulty in linguistic dependencies, such as the subject-verb relation (Van Dyke and Lewis, 2003). However, while mounting evidence implicates retrieval interference in sentence processing, the nature of the retrieval cues involved - and thus the source of difficulty - remains largely unexplored. Three experiments used self-paced reading and eyetracking to examine the ways in which the retrieval cues provided at a verb characterize subjects. Syntactic theory has identified a number of properties correlated with subjecthood, both phrase-structural and thematic. Findings replicate and extend previous findings of interference at a verb from additional subjects, but indicate that retrieval outcomes are relativized to the syntactic domain in which the retrieval occurs. One, the cues distinguish between thematic subjects in verbal and nominal domains. Two, within the verbal domain, retrieval is sensitive to abstract syntactic properties associated with subjects and their clauses. We argue that the processing at a verb requires cue-driven retrieval, and that the retrieval cues utilize abstract grammatical properties which may reflect parser expectations.},

abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is undoubtedly the most common inferential technique used to justify claims in the social sciences. However, even staunch defenders of NHST agree that its outcomes are often misinterpreted. Confidence intervals (CIs) have frequently been proposed as a more useful alternative to NHST, and their use is strongly encouraged in the APA Manual. Nevertheless, little is known about how researchers interpret CIs. In this study, 120 researchers and 442 students-all in the field of psychology-were asked to assess the truth value of six particular statements involving different interpretations of a CI. Although all six statements were false, both researchers and students endorsed, on average, more than three statements, indicating a gross misunderstanding of CIs. Self-declared experience with statistics was not related to researchers' performance, and, even more surprisingly, researchers hardly outperformed the students, even though the students had not received any education on statistical inference whatsoever. Our findings suggest that many researchers do not know the correct interpretation of a CI. The misunderstandings surrounding p-values and CIs are particularly unfortunate because they constitute the main tools by which psychologists draw conclusions from data.},

abstract = {Linguistic dependencies between non-adjacent words have been shown to cause comprehension difficulty, compared with local dependencies. According to one class of sentence comprehension accounts, non-local dependencies are difficult because they require the retrieval of the first dependent from memory when the second dependent is encountered. According to these memory-based accounts, making the first dependent accessible at the time when the second dependent is encountered should help alleviate the difficulty associated with the processing of non-local dependencies. In a dual-task paradigm, participants read sentences that did or did not contain a non-local dependency (i.e., object- and subject-extracted cleft constructions) while simultaneously remembering a word. The memory task was aimed at making the word held in memory accessible throughout the sentence. In an object-extracted cleft (e.g., It was Ellen whom John consulted{\ldots}), the object (Ellen) must be retrieved from memory when consulted is encountered. In the critical manipulation, the memory word was identical to the verb's object (ELLEN). In these conditions, the extraction effect was reduced in the comprehension accuracy data and eliminated in the reading time data. These results add to the body of evidence supporting memory-based accounts of syntactic complexity.},

Participants read texts in which a biased ambiguous word was encountered twice while their eye movements were measured. The context preceding the first encounter varied in the extent to which the subordinate meaning was supported; the context preceding the second encounter always supported the dominant meaning. The findings suggest that lexical access is exhaustive but can be influenced by context, and that the subsequent accessibility of the contextually inappropriate meaning is unaffected by previous selection processes.

abstract = {The main goal of this paper was to disentangle encoding and retrieval interference effects in anaphor processing and thus to evaluate the hy- pothesis predicting that structurally inaccessible nouns (distractors) are not considered to be potential anaphor antecedents during language pro- cessing (Nicol {\&} Swinney, 1989). Three self-paced reading experiments were conducted: one in German, comparing gender-unmarked reflexives and gender-marked pronouns, and two in Russian, comparing gender- marked and gender-unmarked reflexives. In the German experiment, no interference effects were found. In the first experiment in Russian, an unexpected reading times pattern emerged: in the condition where the distractor matched the gender of the reflexive's antecedent, reading of the gender-unmarked, but not the gender-marked reflexives was slowed down. The same reading times pattern was replicated in a second experiment in Russian where the order of the reflexive and the main verb was inverted. We conclude that the results of the two experiments in Russian are in- consistent with the retrieval interference account, but can be explained by encoding interference and additional semantic processing efforts asso- ciated with the processing of gender-marked reflexives. In sum, we found no evidence that would allow us to reject the syntax as an early filer ac- count (Nicol {\&} Swinney, 1989)},

We test whether RNNs trained with a generic language modeling objective in four languages (Italian, English, Hebrew, Russian) can predict long-distance number agreement in various constructions. We include in our evaluation nonsensical sentences where RNNs cannot rely on semantic or lexical cues ("The colorless green ideas I ate with the chair sleep furiously"), and, for Italian, we compare model performance to human intuitions. Our language-model-trained RNNs make reliable predictions about long-distance agreement, and do not lag much behind human performance. We thus bring support to the hypothesis that RNNs are not just shallow-pattern extractors, but they also acquire deeper grammatical competence.},

In the same LMM, we estimated parameters describing the distributions of these effects across subjects. Subjects' frequency and priming effects correlated positively with each other and negatively with mean RT. These correlation estimates, however, emerged only with a reciprocal transformation of RT (i.e., -1/RT), justified on the basis of distributional analyses. Different correlations, some with opposite sign, were obtained (1) for untransformed or logarithmic RTs or (2) when correlations were computed using within-subject analyses. We discuss the relevance of the new results for accounts of masked priming, implications of applying RT transformations, and the use of LMMs as a tool for the joint analysis of experimental effects and associated individual differences.},

abstract = {Whereas it has long been assumed that most linguistic processes underlying language production happen automatically, accumulating evidence suggests that these processes do require some form of attention. Here we investigated the contribution of sustained attention: the ability to maintain alertness over time. In Experiment 1, participants' sustained attention ability was measured using auditory and visual continuous performance tasks. Subsequently, employing a dual-task procedure, participants described pictures using simple noun phrases and performed an arrow-discrimination task while their vocal and manual response times (RTs) and the durations of their gazes to the pictures were measured. Earlier research has demonstrated that gaze duration reflects language planning processes up to and including phonological encoding. The speakers' sustained attention ability correlated with the magnitude of the tail of the vocal RT distribution, reflecting the proportion of very slow responses, but not with individual differences in gaze duration. This suggests that sustained attention was most important after phonological encoding. Experiment 2 showed that the involvement of sustained attention was significantly stronger in a dual-task situation (picture naming and arrow discrimination) than in simple naming. Thus, individual differences in maintaining attention on the production processes become especially apparent when a simultaneous second task also requires attentional resources.},

abstract = {People exaggerate the degree to which small samples resemble the population from which they are drawn. To model this belief in the "Law of Small Numbers," I assume that a person exaggerates the likelihood that a short sequence of i.i.d. signals resembles the long-run rate at which those signals are generated. Such a person believes in the "gambler{\&}apos;s fallacy," thinking that early draws of one signal increase the odds of next drawing other signals. When uncertain about the rate, the person overinfers from short sequences of signals that the rate is more extreme than it is, and consequently infers that there is more variation in these rates among different sources than there is. Economic applications are discussed, such as how the model predicts that investors will believe in nonexistent variation in the quality of mutual-fund managers.},

These effects get published, leading to an overconfident belief in replicability. We demonstrate the adverse consequences of this statistical significance filter by conducting seven direct replication attempts (268 participants in total) of a recent paper (Levy {\&} Keller, 2013). We show that the published claims are so noisy that even non-significant results are fully compatible with them. We also demonstrate the contrast between such small-sample studies and a larger-sample study; the latter generally yields a less noisy estimate but also a smaller effect magnitude, which looks less compelling but is more realistic. We reiterate several suggestions from the methodology literature for improving current practices.},

abstract = {Swets et al. (2008) present evidence that the so-called ambiguity advantage (Traxler et al., 1998), which has been explained in terms of the Unrestricted Race Model, can equally well be explained by assuming underspecification in ambiguous conditions driven by task-demands. Specifically, if comprehen-sion questions require that ambiguities be resolved, the parser tends to make an attachment: when questions are about superficial aspects of the target sentence, readers tend to pursue an underspecification strategy. It is reason-able to assume that individual differences in strategy will play a significant role in the application of such strategies, so that studying average behavior may not be informative. In order to study the predictions of the good-enough processing theory, we implemented two versions of underspecification: the partial specification model (PSM), which is an implementation of the Swets et al. proposal, and a more parsimonious version, the non-specification model (NSM). We evaluate the relative fit of these two kinds of underspecification to Swets et al.'s data; as a baseline, we also fit three models that assume no underspecification. We find that a model without unspecification pro-vides a somewhat better fit than both underspecification models, while the NSM model provides a better fit than the PSM. We interpret the results as lack of unambiguous evidence in favor of underspecification; however, given that there is considerable existing evidence for good-enough processing in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that some underspecification might occur. Under this assumption, the results can be interpreted as tentative ev-idence for NSM over PSM. More generally, our work provides a method for choosing between models of real-time processes in sentence comprehension that make qualitative predictions about the relationship between several de-pendent variables. We believe that sentence processing research will greatly benefit from a wider use of such methods.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we focus on a previously ignored aspect of sentence processing theories: is processing difficulty caused by reanalysis or competition? According to two-stage theories (e.g., Frazier, 1979; Rayner, Frazier, {\{}{\&}{\}} Carlson, 1983), reanalysis should occur when an initially adopted reading is inappropriate. In contrast, current constraint-based theories (e.g., MacDonald, 1994; McRae, Spivey-Knowlton, {\{}{\&}{\}} Tanenhaus, 1998) claim that processing difficulty is due to a competition between two or more syntactic analyses that are about equally activated. We review a number of eye-tracking experiments investigating this issue. No competition was observed in any of the experiments, thus ruling out current constraint-based theories. In fact, the opposite pattern emerged: sentences that should have produced processing difficulty according to constraint-based theories were actually easier to process than sentences that should not have produced difficulty. The data also turn out to be problematic for two-stage theories, as non-syntactic information appears to be employed before the point of reanalysis. The data provide evidence for a new model of syntactic ambiguity resolution (cf. Traxler, Pickering, {\{}{\&}{\}} Clifton, 1998; Van Gompel, Pickering, {\{}{\&}{\}} Traxler, 1999), the unrestricted race model. In this model, processing difficulty is due to reanalysis, but multiple sources of information can determine which analysis is initially adopted.},

abstract = {The psychometric function relates an observer' s performance to an independent variable, usually a phys-ical quantity of an experimental stimulus. Even if a model is successfully fit to the data and its goodness of fit is acceptable, experimenters require an estimate of the variability of the parameters to assess whether differences across conditions are significant. Accurate estimates of variability are difficult to obtain, how-ever, given the typically small size of psychophysical data sets: Traditional statistical techniques are only asymptotically correct and can be shown to be unreliable in some common situations. Here and in our companion paper (Wichmann {\&} Hill, 2001), we suggest alternative statistical techniques based on Monte Carlo resampling methods. The present paper' s principal topic is the estimation of the variability of fitted parameters and derived quantities, such as thresholds and slopes. First, we outline the basic bootstrap procedure and argue in favor of the parametric, as opposed to the nonparametric, bootstrap. Second, we describe how the bootstrap bridging assumption, on which the validity of the procedure depends, can be tested. Third, we show how one' s choice of sampling scheme (the placement of sample points on the stimulus axis) strongly affects the reliability of bootstrap confidence intervals, and we make recom-mendations on how to sample the psychometric function efficiently. Fourth, we show that, under cer-tain circumstances, the (arbitrary) choice of the distribution function can exert an unwanted influence on the size of the bootstrap confidence intervals obtained, and we make recommendations on how to avoid this influence. Finally, we introduce improved confidence intervals (bias corrected and accelerated) that improve on the parametric and percentile-based bootstrap confidence intervals previously used. Software implementing our methods is available.},

abstract = {predictions about upcoming syntactic structure. This study examines how sentence processing is affected by readers' uncertainty in their expectations about upcoming structure. In a self-paced reading study, we manipulate both expectations and the uncertainty about them factorially, based on lexical subcategorization information. We compare two types of uncertainty: uncertainty about the verb's complement, reflecting the next prediction step; and uncertainty about the full sentence, reflecting an unbounded number of prediction steps. We find that uncertainty about the full structure, but not about the next step, was a significant predictor of processing difficulty: Greater reduction in uncertainty was correlated with increase reading times. We additionally replicated previously observed effects of expectation violation (surprisal), orthogonal to the effect of uncertainty. This suggests that both surprisal and uncertainty have a role to play in explaining human reading times. We discuss the consequences for theories of sentence comprehension.},

abstract = {This paper presents results from a self-paced reading experiment in Japanese investigating attachment preferences for relative clauses to three ensuing potential nominal heads. Similar to previous results from the processing of English, Spanish and German, we observed the following non-monotonic preference ordering among the three attachment sites: most local, least local, intermediate. We discuss the result in light of two types of parsing models: models that only consider attaching a modifier to candidate sites whose lexical heads have already been encountered, and models in which predicted categories are also considered as possible modification sites. We contend that the preference to attach to the least local site over the intermediate site argues against the first type of model, and supports the second type of model with a factor such as predicate proximity or anaphor resolution driving the preference to attach the RC to the least local candidate site.},

We review simple procedures for capturing characteristics of underlying RT distributions and show how such procedures have recently been useful to better understand effects from standard cognitive experimental paradigms and individual differences in performance. These well-studied procedures for understanding RT distributions indicate that effects in means can be produced by (a) shifts of RT distributions, (b) stretching of slow tails of RT distributions, or (c) some combination. Importantly, effects in means can actually be obscured by opposing influ- ences on the modal and tail portions of RT distributions. Such disparate patterns demand novel theoretical interpretations.},

abstract = {In the recent literature there has been considerable confusion about the three types of memory: long-term, short-term, and working memory. This chapter strives to reduce that confusion and makes up-to-date assessments of these types of memory. Long- and short-term memory could differ in two fundamental ways, with only short-term memory demonstrating (1) temporal decay and (2) chunk capacity limits. Both properties of short-term memory are still controversial but the current literature is rather encouraging regarding the existence of both decay and capacity limits. Working memory has been conceived and defined in three different, slightly discrepant ways: as short-term memory applied to cognitive tasks, as a multi-component system that holds and manipulates information in short-term memory, and as the use of attention to manage short-term memory. Regardless of the definition, there are some measures of memory in the short term that seem routine and do not correlate well with cognitive aptitudes and other measures (those usually identified with the term "working memory") that seem more attention demanding and do correlate well with these aptitudes.

abstract = {In the present study, event-related brain potentials (ERP) were recorded to investigate the role of pitch accent and lexical tone in spoken discourse comprehension. Chinese was used as material to explore the potential difference in the nature and time course of brain responses to sentence meaning as indicated by pitch accent and to lexical meaning as indicated by tone. In both cases, the pitch contour of critical words was varied. The results showed that both inconsistent pitch accent and inconsistent lexical tone yielded N400 effects, and there was no interaction between them. The negativity evoked by inconsistent pitch accent had the some topography as that evoked by inconsistent lexical tone violation, with a maximum over central-parietal electrodes. Furthermore, the effect for the combined violations was the sum of effects for pure pitch accent and pure lexical tone violation. However, the effect for the lexical tone violation appeared approximately 90 ms earlier than the effect of the pitch accent violation. It is suggested that there might be a correspondence between the neural mechanism underlying pitch accent and lexical meaning processing in context. They both reflect the integration of the current information into a discourse context, independent of whether the current information was sentence meaning indicated by accentuation, or lexical meaning indicated by tone. In addition, lexical meaning was processed earlier than sentence meaning conveyed by pitch accent during spoken language processing. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Understanding a sentence requires a working memory of the partial products of comprehension, so that linguistic relations between temporally distal parts of the sentence can be rapidly computed. We describe an emerging theoretical framework for this working memory system that incorporates several independently motivated principles of memory: a sharply limited attentional focus, rapid retrieval of item (but not order) information subject to interference from similar items, and activation decay (forgetting over time). A computational model embodying these principles provides an explanation of the functional capacities and severe limitations of human processing, as well as accounts of reading times. The broad implication is that the detailed nature of cross-linguistic sentence processing emerges from the interaction of general principles of human memory with the specialized task of language comprehension.},

While an N2pc component was elicited in an identical fashion in both tasks, a subsequent sustained contralateral negativity was consistently present at posterior sites in the discrimination task only. This dissociation demonstrates that these two activations reflect distinct visual processing stages. We suggest that while the N2pc reflects the ability of the visual system both to identify and localise a relevant stimulus in the scene, the late sustained activity reflects the subsequent in-depth analysis and identification of these stimuli.},

abstract = {Research on language comprehension has focused on the resolution of syntactic ambiguities, and most studies have employed garden-path sentences to determine the system's preferences and to assess its use of nonsyntactic sources information. A topic that has been neglected is how syntactically challenging but essentially unambiguous sentences are processed, including passives and object-clefts-sentences that require thematic roles to be assigned in an atypical order. The three experiments described here tested the idea that sentences are processed both algorithmically and heuristically. Sentences were presented aurally and the participants' task was to identify the thematic roles in the sentence (e.g., Who was the do-er?). The first experiment demonstrates that passives are frequently and systematically misinterpreted, especially when they express implausible ideas. The second shows that the surface frequency of a syntactic form does not determine ease of processing, as active sentences and subject-clefts were comprehended equally easily despite the rareness of the latter type. The third experiment compares the processing of subject- and object-clefts, and the results show that they are similar to actives and passives, respectively, again despite the infrequent occurrence in English of any type of cleft. The results of the three experiments suggest that a comprehensive theory of language comprehension must assume that simple processing heuristics are used during processing in addition to (and perhaps sometimes instead of) syntactic algorithms. Moreover, the experiments support the idea that language processing is often based on shallow processing, yielding a merely "good enough" rather than a detailed linguistic representation of an utterance's meaning. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

@article{Qian2012,
abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge in accounts motivated by information theory that consider language production to be partially driven by a preference for communicative efficiency. Evidence from discourse production (i.e., production beyond the sentence level) has been argued to suggest that speakers distribute information across discourse so as to hold the conditional per-word entropy associated with each word constant, which would facilitate efficient information transfer (Genzel {\&} Charniak, 2002). This hypothesis implies that the conditional (contextualized) probabilities of linguistic units affect speakers' preferences during production. Here, we extend this work in two ways. First, we explore how preceding cues are integrated into contextualized probabilities, a question which so far has received little to no attention. Specifically, we investigate how a cue's maximal informativity about upcoming words (the cue's effectiveness) decays as a function of the cue's recency. Based on properties of linguistic discourses as well as properties of human memory, we analytically derive a model of cue effectiveness decay and evaluate it against cross-linguistic data from 12 languages. Second, we relate the information theoretic accounts of discourse production to well-established mechanistic (activation-based) accounts: We relate contextualized probability distributions over words to their relative activation in a lexical network given preceding discourse.},

abstract = {Many studies have shown that attraction effects are consistently found for linguistic dependencies like subject-verb agreement, e.g., *The key to the cabinets are on the table. However, not all dependencies are equally susceptible to attraction. A parade case involves reflexive-antecedent dependencies, which rarely show attraction effects. The contrast between agreement and reflexives with respect to attraction has motivated various proposals regarding the memory architecture for the parser, including the use of qualitatively different access mechanisms or the selective use of morphological features as retrieval cues for different dependencies. In this paper, we show how to systematically induce attraction effects for reflexives in three eye-tracking experiments. Furthermore, we show based on computational simulations that it is possible to derive both the presence and absence of reflexive attraction from the same retrieval mechanism, based on the ACT-R architecture. We then propose an account of why agreement and reflexives are differentially susceptible to attraction, based on the predictability of the dependency.},

Massaro, Cohen, Campbell, and Rodriguez (2001) favor root mean squared deviation (RMSD), choosing the model that provides the best fit to the data. Their simulation results appear to legitimize its use for comparing two models of information integration because it performed just as well as Bayesian model selection (BMS), which had previously been shown by Myung and Pitt (1997) to be a superior alternative selection method because it considers a model's complexity in addition to its fit. In the present study, after contrasting the theoretical approaches to model selection espoused by Massaro et al. and Myung and Pitt, we discuss the cause of the inconsistencies by expanding on the simulations of Massaro et al. Findings demonstrate that the results from model recovery simulations can be misleading if they are not interpreted relative to the data on which they were evaluated, and that BMS is a more robust selection method.},

Although this gives rise to the well-known multiple comparisons problem, i.e.{\~{}}an inflated probability that the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected (Type I error), it is accepted standard practice not to apply any correction procedures. Instead, there is a widespread belief that corrections are not necessary because the increase in false positives is too small to matter. To our knowledge, no formal argument has ever been made to justify this assumption. Here, we report an investigation of this issue using Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that false positives are in fact increased to unacceptable levels when no correction is applied, which casts doubt on the assumptions that Type I error rate increases are too small to matter in practice. We also tested two stricter alternative criteria for determining the reliability of an effect and found that the Bonferroni correction controls false positives effectively while only moderately reducing power. Thus, there is little reason why the Bonferroni correction should not be made a standard requirement for analyses of eye movement data in reading.},

abstract = {This dissertation is concerned with the problem of how structured linguistic representations interact with the architecture of human memory. Much recent work has attempted to unify real-time linguistic memory with a general content-addressable architecture (Lewis {\&} Vasishth, 2005; McElree, 2006). Because grammatical principles and constraints are strongly relational in nature, and linguistic representation hierarchical, this kind of architecture is not well suited to restricting the search of memory to grammatically-licensed constituents alone. This dissertation investigates under what conditions real-time language comprehension is grammatically accurate. Two kinds of grammatical dependencies were examined in reading time and speeded grammaticality experiments: subject-verb agreement licensing in agreement attraction configurations (“The runners who the driver wave to ...”; Kimball {\&} Aissen, 1971, Bock {\&} Miller, 1991), and active completion of wh-dependencies. We develop a simple formal model of agreement attraction in an associative memory that makes accurate predictions across different structures. We conclude that dependencies that can only be licensed exclusively retrospectively, by searching the memory to generate candidate analyses, are the most prone to grammatical infidelity. The exception may be retrospective searches with especially strong contextual restrictions, as in reflexive anaphora. However dependencies that can be licensed principally by a prospective search, like wh-dependencies or backwards anaphora, are highly grammatically accurate.},

In the first experiment, we manipulated prosody. The results showed that when prosodic structure conflicted with syntactic structure, pupil diameter reliably increased. In the second experiment, we manipulated both prosody and visual context. The results showed that when visual context was consistent with the correct interpretation, prosody had very little effect on processing effort. However, when visual context was inconsistent with the correct interpretation, prosody had a large effect on processing effort. The interaction between visual context and prosody shows that visual context has an effect on online processing and that it can modulate the influence of linguistic sources of information, such as prosody.

abstract = {The results of two experiments indicate that individual differences in syntactic processing are governed in part by the amount of working memory capacity available for language comprehension processes. Reading the verbs of an object relative sentence, such as The reporter that the senator attacked admitted the error, takes more time for readers with less working memory capacity for language, and their resulting comprehension is less accurate. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of a concurrent working memory load and found that with no load or a small memory load many Low Span readers comprehended object relative sentences very poorly although their reading times in the critical area of these sentences were greater than those of High Span subjects. Experiment 2 replicated the reading time effects of Experiment 1 for object relative sentences and showed that pragmatic information improved the comprehension of the lower capacity readers, although their use of this in-formation was limited to the clause in which it was presented. o IW Academic press, IIIC. In this paper, we develop the hypothesis that individual differences in syntactic pro-cessing can be observed in normal readers, and that these differences are influenced by differences in working memory capacity for language. Although the processing of syn-tax has been an active topic of language research for several decades, only a few re-searchers have examined individual differ-ences in the processing of syntactic infor-mation (e.g., Gleitman {\&} Gleitman, 1970; Holmes, 1987). The present research inves-tigates how syntactic processing and the re-sulting comprehension of sentences may be influenced by a reader's working memory capacity for language.

abstract = {Several studies have documented the advantage of bilingualism with respect to the development of the executive control (EC) system. Two effects of bilingualism have been described in conflict resolution tasks: (a) bilinguals tend to perform the tasks faster overall, and (b) bilinguals tend to experience less interference from conflicting information, compared to monolinguals. The precise way in which the bilingual advantage relies on different EC mechanisms is still not well understood. The goal of the present article is to further explore how bilingualism impacts the EC system by performing a new analysis (Ex-Gaussian) of already reported data in which bilinguals and monolinguals performed a flanker task. Ex-Gaussian distribution analysis allows us to partial out the contribution of the normal and the exponential components of the RT distribution of the two groups. The fit of the raw data to the ex-Gaussian distribution showed two main results. First, we found that the bilingualism advantage in the overall speed of processing is captured by group differences in the normal ($\mu$) and the exponential ($\tau$) components of the distribution. Second, the bilingual advantage in the magnitude of the conflict effect is captured by group differences only in the exponential component. The results are discussed in terms of: (a) usefulness of the ex-Gaussian analysis as a tool to better describe the RT distribution, and (b) a new approach to explore the cognitive processes purportedly involved in instantiating the bilingualism advantage with respect to EC.},

First, we replicate the suppression of microsaccades with a minimum rate about 150 ms after cue onset. Second, as a new finding we observe microsaccadic enhancement with a maximum rate about 350 ms after presentation of the cue. Third, we find a modulation of the orientation towards the cue direction.

abstract = {Linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) are being increasingly widely used in psychology to analyse multi-level research designs. This feature allows LMMs to address some of the problems identified by Speelman and McGann (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using LMM to analyse skewed reaction time (RT) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013) showed that analyses of raw RT produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identification, which conflicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed RT. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher's theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a GLMM, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.'s datasets. We then consider the broader benefits of using GLMM to investigate individual differences.},

In Russian, the nominative plural forms of some nouns coincide not only with their accusative plural forms but also with the genitive singular. In one production and two comprehension experiments, such genitive singular forms were found to trigger larger attraction effects than morphologically unambiguous genitive plural forms.

In their view, processing capacity emerges from network architecture and experienceand is not a primitive that can vary independently. Individual differences in comprehension do not stemfrom variations in a separate working memory capacity; instead they emerge from an interaction ofbiological factors and language experience. This alternative is argued to provide a superior account ofcomprehension results previously attributed to a separate working memory capacity.},

abstract = {Previous research has shown that neural responses to words during sentence comprehension are sensitive to both lexical repetition and a word's predictability in context. While previous research has often contrasted the effects of these variables (e.g. by looking at cases in which word repetition violates sentence-level constraints), little is known about how they work in tandem. In the current study we examine how recent exposure to a word and its predictability in context combine to impact lexical semantic processing. We devise a novel paradigm that combines reading comprehension with a recognition memory task, allowing for an orthogonal manipulation of a word's predictability and its repetition status. Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we show that word repetition and predictability have qualitatively similar and additive effects on the N400 amplitude. We propose that prior exposure to a word and predictability impact lexical semantic processing in an additive and independent fashion.},

Five elementary but important types of queueing networks are described in detail with regard to their predictions for RT behavior, and they are used to re-examine existing models for psychological processes. As continuous-transmission networks in the general form, queueing network models include the existing discrete and continuous serial models and discrete network models as special cases, cover a broader range of temporal and architectural structures that mental processes might assume, and can be subjected to empirical tests.},

The procedure involves generating survival curves for two conditions, and using a bootstrapping technique to estimate the timing of the earliest discernible divergence between curves. In the present paper, several key extensions for this procedure were proposed and evaluated by conducting simulations and by reanalyzing data from previous studies. Our findings indicate that the modified versions of the procedure performed substantially better than the original procedure under conditions of low experimental power. Furthermore, unlike the original procedure, the modified procedures provided divergence point estimates for individual participants and permitted testing the significance of the difference between estimates across conditions.The advantages of the modified procedures are illustrated, the theoretical and methodological implications are discussed, and promising future directions are outlined.},

abstract = {In this paper we briefly study the basic idea of Akaike's (1973) information criterion (AIC). Then, we present some recent developments on a new entropic or information complexity (ICOMP) criterion of Bozdogan (1988a, 1988b, 1990, 1994d, 1996, 1998a, 1998b) for model selection. A rationale for ICOMP as a model selection criterion is that it combines a badness-of-fit term (such as minus twice the maximum log likelihood) with a measure of complexity of a model differently than AIC, or its variants, by taking into account the interdependencies of the parameter estimates as well as the dependencies of the model residuals. We operationalize the general form of ICOMP based on the quantification of the concept of overall model complexity in terms of the estimated inverse-Fisher information matrix. This approach results in an approximation to the sum of two Kullback-Leibler distances. Using the correlational form of the complexity, we further provide yet another form of ICOMP to take into account the interdependencies (i.e., correlations) among the parameter estimates of the model. Later, we illustrate the practical utility and the importance of this new model selection criterion by providing several real as well as Monte Carlo simulation examples and compare its performance against AIC, or its variants.

abstract = {Much of science is (rightly or wrongly) driven by hypothesis testing. Even in situations where the hypothesis testing paradigm is correct, the common practice of basing inferences solely on p-values has been under intense criticism for over 50 years. We propose, as an alternative, the use of the odds of a correct rejection of the null hypothesis to incorrect rejection. Both pre-experimental versions (involving the power and Type I error) and post-experimental versions (depending on the actual data) are considered. Implementations are provided that range from depending only on the pvalue to consideration of full Bayesian analysis. A surprise is that all implementations — even the full Bayesian analysis — have complete frequentist justification. Versions of our proposal can be implemented that require only minor modifications to existing practices yet overcome some of their most severe shortcomings.},

abstract = {(from the chapter) Discusses the dependency locality theory (DLT) of human computational resources in sentence parsing that relies on 2 kinds of resource use. One of the key ideas underlying the theory is locality, such that the cost of integrating 2 elements (such as a head and a dependent, or a pronominal referent to its antecedent) depends on the distance between the 2. The remainder of the chapter reviews some empirical observations regarding the proceeding difficulty associated with unambiguous structures. It is shown that the DLT accounts for the complexity effect in these structures as well as preferences in ambiguous structures. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2000 APA, all rights reserved).},

Experiment 1:
- Participants read passages of text. Questions of five types: (1) factual questions, (2) number questions, (3) structure questions, (4) higher-order quesitons, and (5) (word) recognition questions
- Participants received points for correct answers times points for reading speed. No points at all if reading too slow. Points were converted to cash.
- DV: Reading time per passage. 
- Some participants always got the same type of question. One group received different types.
- No reading time difference for the first passage, *but* for the last passage the reading time increased with the difficulty of the questions. (The effect does not seem very large though.)},

abstract = {To examine the nature of the information that guides eye movements to previously read text during reading (regressions), we used a relatively novel technique to request a regression to a particular target word when the eyes reached a predefined location during sentence reading. A regression was to be directed to a close or a distant target when either the first or the second line of a complex two-line sentence was read. In addition, conditions were created that pitted effects of spatial and linguistic distance against each other. Initial regressions were more accurate when the target was spatially near, and effects of spatial distance dominated effects of verbal distance. Initial regressions rarely moved the eyes onto the target, however, and subsequent “corrective” regressions that homed in on the target were subject to general linguistic processing demands, being more accurate during firstline reading than during second-line reading. The results suggest that spatial and verbal memory guide regressions in reading. Initial regressions are primarily guided by fixation-centered spatial memory, and corrective regressions are primarily guided by linguistic knowledge.},

Similar results, but regressions were quite imprecise, and precision was less accurate when the distance was longer. Again the data is compatible with coarse spatial info or location reconstruction based on verbal info.




EXPERIMENT 1:
Gaze-contingent speech-technique: Participants hear an already read word
while reading a follow-up word. They have to move their gaze back to the word the hear. Sentences to-be-read extended over two lines. 




In half of the conditions [Subexp 1], regessions were initiated from the end of the first or second line, and the distance to the target was manipulated.
Conditions:
* Regression distance (long/short) x Regression domain (first/second line)




PREDICTIONS:
(Very questionable predictions)
* If verbal knowledge is used to infer location, accuracy should be lower on the second line, due to higher "verbal load", and thus higher interference. There should be no difference if spatial coordinates are stored, because they are much more implicit.
They relate it to a Miyake et al. (1994) paper, which seems to discuss something along the lines of digging in effects.
[I guess I agree with the general idea of storage=spatial vs. reconstruction=verbal. Higher load+reconstruction should really lead to worse performance.]








In another half of the conditions [Subexp 2], regressions were started from the beginning of the second line. Verbal and spatial distance were dissociated, or rather always mismatched. Sometimes the first line was masked with random characters, before the probe was presented.

abstract = {In the field of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage-Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility.},

This paper reviews existing tests and presents several new results that can be used to test these assumptions. First, in the case in which the duration of an inserted stage is exponentially distributed, it is shown that the observable RT density functions must always intersect at the mode of the density requiring the extra processing stage. Second, when Assumption 1 is made, it is shown that the cumulative RT distribution functions and, in many cases, the hazard functions must be ordered. When only Assumption 2 is assumed, it is shown that, under fairly weak conditions, the tail of the RT density function must be exponential. The 1st 2 results are applied to data from a memory scanning experiment, and the 2 assumptions are found to receive tentative support. (42 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2003 APA )},

In the corpus, Pirah{\~{a}} sentences have been shallowly parsed and given morpheme-aligned English translations. We use the corpus to investigate the formal complexity of Pirah{\~{a}} syntax by searching for evidence of syntactic embedding. In particular, we search for sentences which could be analyzed as containing center-embedding, sentential complements, adverbials, complementizers, embedded possessors, conjunction or disjunction. We do not find unambiguous evidence for recursive embedding of sentences or noun phrases in the corpus. We find that the corpus is plausibly consistent with an analysis of Pirah{\~{a}} as a regular language, although this is not the only plausible analysis.},

In Experiment 1, skipping rates were higher for a preview of a predictable word than for a visually similar nonword, indicating there is full recognition in parafoveal vision. In Experiment 2, foveal load was manipulated by varying the frequency of the word preceding either a 3-letter target word or a misspelled preview. There was again a higher skipping rate for a correct preview and a lower skipping rate when there was a high foveal load, but there was no interaction, and the pattern of effects in fixation times was the same as in the skipping data. Experiment 2 also showed significant skipping of nonwords similar to the target word, indicating skipping based on partial information.},

abstract = {We explore the idea that eye-movement strategies in reading are precisely adapted to the joint constraints of task structure, task payoff, and processing architecture. We present a model of saccadic control that separates a parametric control policy space from a parametric machine architecture, the latter based on a small set of assumptions derived from research on eye movements in reading (Engbert, Nuthmann, Richter, {\&} Kliegl, 2005; Reichle, Warren, {\&} McConnell, 2009). The eye-control model is embedded in a decision architecture (a machine and policy space) that is capable of performing a simple linguistic task integrating information across saccades. Model predictions are derived by jointly optimizing the control of eye movements and task decisions under payoffs that quantitatively express different desired speed-accuracy trade-offs. The model yields distinct eye-movement predictions for the same task under different payoffs, including single-fixation durations, frequency effects, accuracy effects, and list position effects, and their modulation by task payoff. The predictions are compared to-and found to accord with-eye-movement data obtained from human participants performing the same task under the same payoffs, but they are found not to accord as well when the assumptions concerning payoff optimization and processing architecture are varied. These results extend work on rational analysis of oculomotor control and adaptation of reading strategy (Bicknell {\&} Levy, ; McConkie, Rayner, {\&} Wilson, 1973; Norris, 2009; Wotschack, 2009) by providing evidence for adaptation at low levels of saccadic control that is shaped by quantitatively varying task demands and the dynamics of processing architecture.},

The linguistic characteristics of Odawa are quite different from those found in the languages most often examined by psycholinguists. The data obtained from the sentence production experiment reported here are thus relevant to production in a heretofore unexamined language. Moreover, the data inform broader theoretical issues, such as the extent to which sentence production can be considered as an incremental process, and the interaction of the various factors affecting conceptual accessibility. In addition, the study stands as evidence that experimental psycholinguistic research can and should be carried out in typologically diverse languages.},

This article addresses these issues from both computational and developmental perspectives. First, I argue that statistical learning using transitional probabilities cannot reliably segment words when scaled to a realistic setting (e.g. child-directed English). To be successful, it must be constrained by knowledge of phonological structure. Then, turning to the bona fide theory of innateness - the Principles and Parameters framework - I argue that a full explanation of children's grammar development must abandon the domain-specific learning model of triggering, in favor of probabilistic learning mechanisms that might be domain-general but nevertheless operate in the domain-specific space of syntactic parameters.},

This phenomenon, generally referred to as post-error slowing, has been hypothesized to reflect perceptual distraction, time wasted on irrelevant processes, an a priori bias against the response made in error, increased variability in a priori bias, or an increase in response caution. Although the response caution interpretation has dominated the empirical literature, little research has attempted to test this interpretation in the context of a formal process model. Here, we used the drift diffusion model to isolate and identify the psychological processes responsible for post-error slowing. In a very large lexical decision data set, we found that post-error slowing was associated with an increase in response caution and-to a lesser extent-a change in response bias. In the present data set, we found no evidence that post-error slowing is caused by perceptual distraction or time wasted on irrelevant processes. These results support a response-monitoring account of post-error slowing.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: This review provides a summary of the most recent advances on the study of how prosody is used during language comprehension. Prosody is characterized as an abstract structure composed of discrete tonal elements aligned with the segmental composition of the sentence organized in constituents of increasing size, and this structure is influenced by the phonological, syntactic, and informational structures of the sentence. Here, we discuss evidence that listeners are affected by prosody when establishing those linguistic structures. Prosody has been shown to influence the segmentation of the utterance into syllables and words, and, in some cases, whether a syllable or word is judged to be present or not. The literature on how prosody informs the structural relationship between words and phrases is also discussed, contrasting views that assume a direct (albeit probabilistic) link between syntax and prosody with those that posit a complex interface between syntax and prosodic structure. Finally, the role of prosody in conveying important aspects pertaining to the sentence's information structure (i.e., which parts of the sentence's meaning are highlighted and brought forward to the discourse, which ones are presupposed and left in the background, which attitudes are being conveyed about the concepts or propositional content) has long been recognized. Current research focuses on which prosodic elements contribute to marking the dimensions (or semantic primitives) of the information structure.

abstract = {We studied the eye movement parameters during reading of syntactically ambiguous  sentences with feminine relative clause in Russian language. A priori difficulties of sentence structural analysis results in increase of time spent on reading as opposed to reading control sentences (unambiguous). Such a delay is caused by an increase of frequency of regressions (backward saccades) which are executed for rereading an ambiguous fragment ofsentence. This fact in turn leads to an increase in number of fixations and their duration. The total reading time for particular words composing the ambiguous fragment of sentence depended on disambiguation result (relative clause attachment, early/late closure). In case of early closure (when the subject attached relative clause to first noun) the total reading time for this noun exceeded one for second noun. In case of late closure (when the subject attached relative clause to second noun) the total reading time for both nouns didn't differ. Our results indicate that early closure domination in Russian language determines the greater total reading time for first noun of nominal group associated with relative clause.},

abstract = {Eye-movements in reading exhibit frequency spillover effects: fixation durations on a word are affected by the frequency of the previous word. We explore the idea that this effect may be an emer- gent property of a computationally rational eye- movement strategy that is navigating a tradeoff be- tween processing immediate perceptual input, and continued processing of past input based on mem- ory. We present an adaptive eye-movement con- trol model with a minimal capacity for such pro- cessing, based on a composition of thresholded se- quential samplers that integrate information from noisy perception and noisy memory. The model is applied to the List Lexical Decision Task and shown to yield frequency spillover—a robust prop- erty of human eye-movements in this task, even with parafoveal masking. We show that spillover in the model emerges in approximately optimal con- trol policies that sometimes process memory rather than perception. We compare this model with one that is able to give priority to perception over mem- ory, and show that the perception-priority policies in such a model do not perform as well in a range of plausible noise settings. We explain how the frequency spillover arises from a counter-intuitive but fundamental property of sequenced thresholded samplers. 1},

abstract = {Bayesian models of cognition provide a powerful way to understand the behavior and goals of individuals from a computational point of view. Much of the focus in the Bayesian cognitive modeling approach has been on qualitative model evaluations, where predictions from the models are compared to data that is often averaged over individuals. In many cognitive tasks, however, there are pervasive individual differences. We introduce an approach to directly infer individual differences related to subjective mental representations within the framework of Bayesian models of cognition. In this approach, Bayesian data analysis methods are used to estimate cognitive parameters and motivate the inference process within a Bayesian cognitive model. We illustrate this integrative Bayesian approach on a model of memory. We apply the model to behavioral data from a memory experiment involving the recall of heights of people. A cross-validation analysis shows that the Bayesian memory model with inferred subjective priors predicts withheld data better than a Bayesian model where the priors are based on environmental statistics. In addition, the model with inferred priors at the individual subject level led to the best overall generalization performance, suggesting that individual differences are important to consider in Bayesian models of cognition.},

Devices such as morphological case-marking and word order fixations are taken out of the toolbox only if the assignment of semantic roles is not implied by the semantics of the predicate and its arguments. ADDOM-languages (Ambiguity-Driven Differential Object Marking languages) such as Yongren Lolo resist any rigid alignment pattern of semantic roles. Earlier attempts by linguists to sketch Lolo-style syntax in terms of the grammatical relations of primary object and 'anti-ergative' marking are shown to fail for various reasons. The characteristic feature of ADDOM-languages seems to be their ability to strike a special deal between two conflicting constraints that operate at a deeper level of syntactic organization: Economy and Markedness. Based on the interplay of these constraints, I define a wide range of theoretic ADDOM-structures and position Yongren Lolo within this typology. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Three questions have been prominent in the study of visual working memory limitations: (a) What is the nature of mnemonic precision (e.g., quantized or continuous)? (b) How many items are remembered? (c) To what extent do spatial binding errors account for working memory failures? Modeling studies have typically focused on comparing possible answers to a single one of these questions, even though the result of such a comparison might depend on the assumed answers to both others. Here, we consider every possible combination of previously proposed answers to the individual questions. Each model is then a point in a 3-factor model space containing a total of 32 models, of which only 6 have been tested previously. We compare all models on data from 10 delayed-estimation experiments from 6 laboratories (for a total of 164 subjects and 131,452 trials). Consistently across experiments, we find that (a) mnemonic precision is not quantized but continuous and not equal but variable across items and trials; (b) the number of remembered items is likely to be variable across trials, with a mean of 6.4 in the best model (median across subjects); (c) spatial binding errors occur but explain only a small fraction of responses (16.5{\%} at set size 8 in the best model). We find strong evidence against all 6 documented models. Our results demonstrate the value of factorial model comparison in working memory.},

abstract = {Sentence processing takes place in real-time. Previous words in the sentence can influence the processing of the current word in the timescale of hundreds of milliseconds. Recent neurophysiological studies in humans suggest that the fronto-striatal system (frontal cortex, and striatum--the major input locus of the basal ganglia) plays a crucial role in this process. The current research provides a possible explanation of how certain aspects of this real-time processing can occur, based on the dynamics of recurrent cortical networks, and plasticity in the cortico-striatal system. We simulate prefrontal area BA47 as a recurrent network that receives on-line input about word categories during sentence processing, with plastic connections between cortex and striatum. We exploit the homology between the cortico-striatal system and reservoir computing, where recurrent frontal cortical networks are the reservoir, and plastic cortico-striatal synapses are the readout. The system is trained on sentence-meaning pairs, where meaning is coded as activation in the striatum corresponding to the roles that different nouns and verbs play in the sentences. The model learns an extended set of grammatical constructions, and demonstrates the ability to generalize to novel constructions. It demonstrates how early in the sentence, a parallel set of predictions are made concerning the meaning, which are then confirmed or updated as the processing of the input sentence proceeds. It demonstrates how on-line responses to words are influenced by previous words in the sentence, and by previous sentences in the discourse, providing new insight into the neurophysiology of the P600 ERP scalp response to grammatical complexity. This demonstrates that a recurrent neural network can decode grammatical structure from sentences in real-time in order to generate a predictive representation of the meaning of the sentences. This can provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of human cortico-striatal function in sentence processing.},

The Overlay model explains why a reparandum lingers in a listener's representation of an utterance, but it does not capture anticipatory processing. We then develop a different model, based on a Noisy-Channel framework, which assumes a more active process for resolving repair disfluencies. On this model, the listener might predict a repair when the speaker becomes disfluent, or even identify a reparandum if a word seems inconsistent with the speaker's intention. We argue further that predictions during disfluency processing operate via the same mechanism involved in the processing of contrast, in which listeners use contrastive prominence to generate alternates. We conclude by arguing that the Overlay and Noisy-Channel approaches to disfluency processing are not inconsistent, but rather both explain important aspects of disfluency processing in comple...},

The memory-based accounts predict that object relatives are easier to process than subject relatives because, in object relatives, the distance between the relative clause verb and the head noun is shorter. By contrast, expectation-based accounts such as surprisal predict that the less frequent object relative should be harder to process. In previous studies on Chinese relative clause comprehension, local ambiguities may have rendered a comparison between relative clause types uninterpretable. We designed experimental materials in which no local ambiguities confound the comparison. We ran two experiments (self-paced reading and eye-tracking) to compare reading difficulty in subject and object relatives which were placed either in subject or object modifying position. The evidence from our studies is consistent with the predictions of expectation-based accounts but not with those of memory-based theories.},

abstract = {An active question in psycholinguistics is whether or not the parser and grammar reflect distinct cognitive systems. Recent evidence for a distinct-systems view comes from cases of ungram-matical but acceptable antecedent-ellipsis mismatches (e.g., *Tom kicked Bill, and Matt was kicked by Tom too.). The finding that these mismatches show varying degrees of acceptability has been presented as evidence for the use of extra-grammatical parsing strategies that restructure a mismatched antecedent to satisfy the syntactic constraints on ellipsis (Arregui et al. 2006; Kim et al. 2011). In this paper, I argue that it is unnecessary to posit a special class of parser-specific rules to capture the observed profiles, and that acceptable mismatches do not reflect a parser-grammar misalignment. Rather, such effects are a natural consequence of a single structure building system (i.e., the grammar) that relies on noisy, domain-general memory access mechanisms to retrieve an antecedent from memory. In Experiment 1, I confirm the acceptability profiles reported in previous work. Then in Experiment 2, as proof-of-concept, I show using an established computational model of memory retrieval that the observed acceptability profiles follow from independently motivated principles of working memory, without invoking multiple representational systems. These results contribute to a uniform memory-based account of acceptable ungrammaticalities for a wide range of dependencies.},

abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology's lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and large-N designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

abstract = {This paper describes a computer system for understanding English. The system answers questions, executes commands, and accepts information in an interactive English dialog.
It is based on the belief that in modeling language understanding, we must deal in an integrated way with all of the aspects of language--syntax, semantics, and inference. The system contains a parser, a recognition grammar of English, programs for semantic analysis, and a general problem solving system. We assume that a computer cannot deal reasonably with language unless it can understand the subject it is discussing. Therefore, the program is given a detailed model of a particular domain. In addition, the system has a simple model of its own mentality. It can remember and discuss its plans and actions as well as carrying them out. It enters into a dialog with a person, responding to English sentences with actions and English replies, asking for clarification when its heuristic programs cannot understand a sentence through the use of syntactic, semantic, contextual, and physical knowledge. Knowledge in the system is represented in the form of procedures, rather than tables of rules or lists of patterns. By developing special procedural representations for syntax, semantics, and inference, we gain flexibility and power. Since each piece of knowledge can be a procedure, it can call directly on any other piece of knowledge in the system.},

abstract = {Seven experiments, designed to investigate the effects of various factors on word recognition, are reported. For each experiment the subject memorized a list of from 16 to 54 words and then was tested with a sequence of single words; each test involved either a target word (member of the list) or distractor word (not on the memorized list). In response to each test word the subject pressed one of two keys, indicating whether the word was a target or a distractor. Response latency was shown to depend upon the number of prior tests on a given word (Experiment 1) and the length of the target list (Experiment 2). Experiments 3 and 6 demonstrated that response latency to a target word can be decreased by repeating the word in the study list or by otherwise making certain words more salient. Experiments 4,5, and 7 showed that response latency was affected by similarities between target and distractor words and by such word characteristics as frequency, concreteness, and syllable length. The latency and error data were discussed in terms of a model for recognition which assumes that the subject either (1) makes an initial fast response based on the familiarity of the test word or (2) if the familiar" ity is neither high nor low, delays responding until an extended search of the memorized list is carried out. Quantitative predictions generated by the model compare favorably with the data.},

First, it provides a means of estimating the shape, scale, and location (shift) of RT distributions. Second, it is hierarchical and models between-subjects and within-subjects variability simultaneously. Third, inference with the model is Bayesian and provides a principled and efficient means of pooling information across disparate data from different individuals. Because the model efficiently pools information across individuals, it is particularly well suited for those common cases in which the researcher collects a limited number of observations from several participants. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the hierarchical Bayesian model provides more accurate estimates than several popular competitors do. We illustrate the model by providing an analysis of the symbolic distance effect in which participants can more quickly ascertain the relationship between nonadjacent digits than that between adjacent digits.},

abstract = {The mechanism by which visual-spatial attention affects the detection of faint signals has been the subject of considerable debate. It is well known that spatial cuing speeds signal detection. This may imply that attentional cuing modulates the processing of sensory information during detection or, alternatively, that cuing acts to create decision bias favoring input at the cued location. These possibilities were evaluated in 3 spatial cuing experiments. Peripheral cues were used in Experiment 1 and central cues were used in Experiments 2 and 3. Cuing similarly enhanced measured sensitivity, P(A) and d', for simple luminance detection in all 3 experiments. Under some conditions it also induced shifts in decision criteria (beta). These findings indicate that visual-spatial attention facilitates the processing of sensory input during detection either by increasing sensory gain for inputs at cued locations or by prioritizing the processing of cued inputs.},

We formally describe the cognitive structure and parametric properties of the class of MPT models and provide an inferential statistical analysis for the entire class. Following this, we provide a comprehensive review of over 80 applications of MPT models to a variety of substantive areas in cognitive psychology, including various types of human memory, visual and auditory perception, and logical reasoning. We then address a number of theoretical issues relevant to the creation and evaluation of MPT models, including model development, model validity, discrete-state assumptions, statistical issues, and the relation between MPT models and other mathematical models. In the conclusion, we consider the current role of MPT models in psychological research and possible future directions.},

The extreme value model is shown to yield unit slope receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for several classic data sets that are commonly given as examples of normal or logistic ROC curves with slopes that differ from unity. The result is an additive model with a simple interpretation in terms of a shift in the location of an under-lying distribution. The models can also be extended in several ways, such as to recognize response dependencies, to include random coefficients, or to allow for more general underlying probability distributions.},

abstract = {This study is the first to investigate: (a) 'temporal performance fields,' whether the speed of information accrual differs for different locations at a fixed eccentricity, and (b) whether covert attention modulates temporal dynamics differentially at isoeccentric locations. Using the speed accuracy tradeoff (SAT) procedure, we derived conjoint measures of how isoeccentric locations and precueing targets location affect speed and accuracy in a search task. The results demonstrate the existence of temporal performance fields, analogous to spatial performance fields: information accrual was fastest for target on the horizontal meridian, intermediate for targets at the intercardinal locations, slow for targets on the vertical meridian, and slowest for targets at the North (N) location (accrual time pattern: E{\&}W{\textless}intercardinal{\textless}S{\textless}N). Surprisingly, in contrast to spatial performance fields, where covert attention enhanced discriminability at all locations to a similar degree, attention differentially sped up processing at the slower locations, with a greater benefit evident along the vertical than the horizontal meridian, particularly at the N location, and an intermediate benefit at intercardinal locations (viz., N{\textgreater}S{\textgreater}intercardinal{\textgreater}E{\&}W). Hence, the compensatory effect of attention eliminated the temporal asymmetries across isoeccentric locations.},

We ask whether sequential or hierarchical information guides the expectations that a human listener forms about a word's part-of-speech when simply listening to every-day language. We compare the predictions of three computational models against electroencephalography signals recorded from human participants who listen passively to an audiobook story. We find that predictions based on hierarchical structure correlate with the human brain response above-and-beyond predictions based only on sequential information. This establishes a link between hierarchical linguistic structure and neural signals that generalizes across the range of syntactic structures found in every-day language.},

abstract = {Spectacular progress in the information processing sciences (machine learning, wearable sensors) promises to revolutionize the study of cognitive development. Here, we analyse the conditions under which 'reverse engineering' language development, i.e., building an effective system that mimics infant's achievements, can contribute to our scientific understanding of early language development. We argue that, on the computational side, it is important to move from toy problems to the full complexity of the learning situation, and take as input as faithful reconstructions of the sensory signals available to infants as possible. On the data side, accessible but privacy-preserving repositories of home data have to be setup. On the psycholinguistic side, specific tests have to be constructed to benchmark humans and machines at different linguistic levels. We discuss the feasibility of this approach and present an overview of current results.},

The present study reports a single large-scale (N=112) eyetracking experiment in which the frequency and plausibility of a target word in each sentence were factorially manipulated. The results were consistent with E-Z Reader's central predictions: frequency but not plausibility influenced the probability that the word was skipped over by the eyes rather than directly fixated, and the two variables had additive, not interactive, effects on all reading time measures. Evidence in favor of null effects and null interactions was obtained by computing Bayes factors, using the default priors and sampling methods for ANOVA models implemented by Rouder, Morey, Speckman, and Province (2012). The results suggest that though a word's plausibility may have a measurable influence as early as the first fixation duration on the target word, in fact plausibility may be influencing only a post-lexical processing stage, rather than lexical identification itself.},

Attempts to overcome this processing deficit have often failed to reduce the subordinate bias effect (SBE). In the present studies, we examined the processing of biased homographs preceded by 10 single-sentence, subordinate-biasing contexts, and varied whether this preceding context contained a prior instance of the homograph or a control word/phrase. Having previously encountered the homograph earlier in the sentence reduced the SBE for the subsequent encounter, whereas simply instantiating the subordinate meaning produced processing difficulty. We compared these reductions in reading times to differences in processing time between dominant-biased repeated and nonrepeated 15 conditions in order to verify that the reductions observed in the subordinate cases did not simply reflect a general repetition benefit. Our results indicate that a strong, subordinate-biasing context can interact during lexical access to overcome the activation from meaning frequency and reduce the SBE during reading.},

In this chapter, we relate many of these phenomena and show that they might be due to a set of common memory processes, processes that can act through conscious, strategic or unconscious, implicit means. The critical strand that links the phenomena is that memory is a continuous process that constantly stores and retrieves information. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Low-frequency (LF) words have higher hit rates and lower false alarm rates than high-frequency (HF) words in recognition memory, a phenomenon termed the mirror effect. Visual word recognition latencies are longer for LF words. We examined the relationship between eye fixation durations during study and later recognition memory for individual words to test whether (1) increased fixation time on a word is associated with better memory, and (2) increased fixation times on LF words can account for their hit rate advantage. In Experiments 1 and 2, words of various frequencies were presented in lists in an intentional study design. In Experiment 3, HF and LF critical words were presented in matched sentence frames in an incidental study design. In all cases, the standard frequency effect on eye movements emerged, with longer reading times for lower frequency words. At test, studied words and new words from each frequency class were presented. The hit rate portion of the mirror effect was evident in all experiments. The time spent fixating a word did predict memory performance in the intentional encoding experiments, but critically, the frequency effect on hit rates was independent of this effect. Time spent fixating a word during incidental encoding did not predict later memory performance. These results suggest that the hit rate advantage for LF words is not due to the additional time spent on these words at encoding, which is consistent with retrieval-stage models of the mirror effect. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In contrast, no such difference is predicted by the Integration account. As the mixed model allows for an influence of implicit causality during both the stages of focusing and integration, it predicts a congruency effect for both types of anaphor, but a reduced effect when repeated names are used."

abstract = {In the present study we report two self-paced reading experiments that investigate antecedent retrieval processes in sentence comprehension by contrasting the real-time processing behavior of two different reflexive anaphors in Mandarin Chinese. Previous work has suggested that comprehenders initially evaluate the fit between the morphologically simple long-distance reflexive "ziji" and the closest available subject position, only subsequently considering more structurally distant antecedents (Gao et al., 2005; Liu, 2009; Li and Zhou, 2010; Dillon et al., 2014; cf. Chen et al., 2012). In this paper, we investigate whether this locality bias effect obtains for other reflexive anaphors in Mandarin Chinese, or if it is associated specifically with the morphologically simple reflexive ziji. We do this by comparing the processing of ziji to the processing of the morphologically complex reflexive ta-ziji (lit. s/he-self). In Experiment 1, we investigate the processing of ziji, and replicate the finding of a strong locality bias effect for ziji in self-paced reading measures. In Experiment 2, we investigate the processing of the morphologically complex reflexive ta-ziji in the same structural configurations as Experiment 1. A comparison of our experiments reveals that ta-ziji shows a significantly weaker locality bias effect than ziji does. We propose that this results from the difference in the number of morphological and semantic features on the anaphor ta-ziji relative to ziji. Specifically, we propose that the additional retrieval cues associated with ta-ziji reduce interference from irrelevant representations in memory, allowing it to more reliably access an antecedent regardless its linear or structural distance. This reduced interference in turn leads to a diminished locality bias effect for the morphologically complex anaphor ta-ziji.},

Bayesian ideas already match your intuitions from everyday reasoning and from traditional data analysis. Simple examples of Bayesian data analysis are presented that illustrate how the information delivered by a Bayesian analysis can be directly interpreted. Bayesian approaches to null-value assessment are discussed. The article clarifies misconceptions about Bayesian methods that newcomers might have acquired elsewhere. We discuss prior distri- butions and explain how they are not a liability but an important asset. We discuss the relation of Bayesian data analysis to Bayesian models of mind, and we briefly discuss what methodological problems Bayesian data analysis is not meant to solve. After you have read this article, you should have a clear sense of how Bayesian data analysis works and the sort of information it delivers, and why that information is so intuitive and useful for drawing conclusions from data.},

@article{Alcocer2012,
abstract = {How linguistic representations in memory are searched and retrieved during sentence processing is an active question in psycholinguistics. Much work has independently suggested that retrieval operations require constant-time computations, are susceptible to interference, and operate under the constraint of a severely limited focus of attention. These features suggest a model for sentence processing that uses a content-addressable memory (CAM) architecture that accesses items in parallel while relying on only a limited amount of privileged, fast storage. A challenge for a CAM architecture comes from the potentially unbounded configurational relation c-command (equivalent to logical scope) that plays a pervasive role in linguistic phenomena. CAM is well-suited to retrieval of elements based on inherent properties of memory chunks, but relational notions such as c-command involve the properties of pairs of nodes in a structure, rather than inherent properties of individual chunks. To explore this problem, in this paper we adopt an explicit CAM-based model of sentence processing in the context of the ACT-R computational architecture (Lewis {\&} Vasishth, 2005, Cognitive Science, 29, 375-419). We discuss why c-command is a challenge for CAM and explore algorithms for exploiting or approximating c-command online, and discuss their consequences for the model. We identify computational problems that any attention-limited, CAM-based model would have to address.},

the role of storage costs associatedwith maintaining incomplete syntactic

has been equivocal regarding syntactic influences because it has
examined ambiguities where there is littleor no resource differential
between competing alternatives. The candidate structures of the ambiguities
exploredhere incur substantially different storage costs. The results
indicate that storage-based biases can be sufficientlypowerful to
create difficulty for a structural alternative even when it is promoted
by nonsyntactic factors. Thesefindings are incorporated into a model
of ambiguity resolution in which structural biases operate as independentgraded
constraints in selecting between structural alternatives. },

In Experiment 2, additional participants read similar sentences, containing the unambiguous pronouns him or his. The results of both experiments showed that the type of NP occurring in subject position influenced processing on both SPEC and NP pronouns. These results were inconsistent with claims that comprehenders consider only those antecedents that are structurally available as antecedents, following Chomsky's (1981) Binding Theory (Clifton, Kennison, {\&} Albrecht, 1997; Nicol {\&} Swinney, 1989).

abstract = {Time series clustering is an active research area with applications in a wide range of fields. One key component in cluster analysis is determining a proper dissimilarity mea-sure between two data objects, and many criteria have been proposed in the literature to assess dissimilarity between two time series. The R package TSclust is aimed to im-plement a large set of well-established peer-reviewed time series dissimilarity measures, including measures based on raw data, extracted features, underlying parametric models, complexity levels, and forecast behaviors. Computation of these measures allows the user to perform clustering by using conventional clustering algorithms. TSclust also includes a clustering procedure based on p values from checking the equality of generating models, and some utilities to evaluate cluster solutions. The implemented dissimilarity functions are accessible individually for an easier extension and possible use out of the clustering context. The main features of TSclust are described and examples of its use are presented.},

abstract = {Behavioral studies investigating the influence of the relative word frequency of antecedent nouns on the processing of anaphoric pronouns have yielded contradictory results. While some researchers found no effect of an antecedent's frequency of occurrence on coreference resolution [J. Simner, R. Smyth, Phonological activation in anaphoric lexical access (ALA), Brain Lang. 68 (1999) 40-45], others report shorter reading times for pronouns referring to low compared to high frequency nouns [R.G.P. van Gompel, A. Majid, Antecedent frequency effects during the processing of pronouns, Cognition 90 (2004) 255-264]. Using event-related potentials, our study aimed to further investigate the issue. Participants were presented with sentence pairs, of which the first contained either a high frequency, a middle frequency or a low frequency noun. The second sentence contained a pronoun which referred back to the noun in the first sentence. ERP waves were determined, time-locked to both the nouns and the anaphoric pronouns. We observed a graded N400 effect for antecedents of the three frequency classes with amplitudes reversely related to the word's lexical frequency. Coreferential pronouns elicited a P300, with amplitudes dependent on the noun's relative frequency of occurrence, i.e. the lower the antecedent's word frequency, the higher was the amplitude of the P300. This amplitude effect at the pronoun is interpreted in terms of the allocation of attentional resources to salient discourse entities.},

In Experiment 1, the global processing load in simultaneous interpretation as reflected in the average pupil size was compared to that in two other language tasks, listening to and repeating back an auditorily presented text. Experiment 1 showed clear differences between the experimental tasks. In Experiment 2, the task effect was replicated using single words as stimuli. Experiment 2 showed that momentary variations in processing load during a lexical translation task are reflected in pupil size. Words that were chosen to be more difficult to translate induced higher levels of pupil dilation than did easily translatable words. Moreover, repeating back words in a non-native language was accompanied by increased pupil dilations, in comparison to repetition in the subject's native language. In sum, the study lends good support to the use of the pupillary response as an indicator of processing load.},

We surveyed articles published in 2009 and 2010 in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, noting the statistical analyses reported and the associated reporting of effect size estimates. Effect sizes were reported for fewer than half of the analyses; no article reported a confidence interval for an effect size. The most often reported analysis was analysis of variance, and almost half of these reports were not accompanied by effect sizes. Partial $\eta$2 was the most commonly reported effect size estimate for analysis of variance. For t tests, 2/3 of the articles did not report an associated effect size estimate; Cohen's d was the most often reported. We provide a straightforward guide to understanding, selecting, calculating, and interpreting effect sizes for many types of data and to methods for calculating effect size confidence intervals and power analysis.},

abstract = {Phonemes play a central role in traditional theories as units of speech perception and access codes to lexical representations. Phonemes have two essential properties: they are ‘segment-sized' (the size of a consonant or vowel) and abstract (a single phoneme may be have different acoustic realisations). Nevertheless, there is a long history of challenging the phoneme hypothesis, with some theorists arguing for differently sized phonological units (e.g. features or syllables) and others rejecting abstract codes in favour of representations that encode detailed acoustic properties of the stimulus. The phoneme hypothesis is the minority view today. We defend the phoneme hypothesis in two complementary ways. First, we show that rejection of phonemes is based on a flawed interpretation of empirical findings. For example, it is commonly argued that the failure to find acoustic invariances for phonemes rules out phonemes. However, the lack of invariance is only a problem on the assumption that speech perception is a bottom-up process. If learned sublexical codes are modified by top-down constraints (which they are), then this argument loses all force. Second, we provide strong positive evidence for phonemes on the basis of linguistic data. Almost all findings that are taken (incorrectly) as evidence against phonemes are based on psycholinguistic studies of single words. However, phonemes were first introduced in linguistics, and the best evidence for phonemes comes from linguistic analyses of complex word forms and sentences. In short, the rejection of phonemes is based on a false analysis and a too-narrow consideration of the relevant data.},

They argued that the distribution of gaze steps is best fit by the lognormal distribution, and based on this analysis they concluded that interactive cognitive processes underlie eye movement control in these tasks. The present comment argues that the gaze step distribution is predictable based on the fact that the eyes alternate between a fixation state in which gaze is steady and a saccade state in which gaze position changes rapidly. By fitting a simple mixture model to Stephen and Mirman's gaze step data we reveal a fixation distribution and a saccade distribution. This mixture model captures the shape of the gaze step distribution in detail, unlike the lognormal model, and provides a better quantitative fit to the data. We conclude that the gaze step distribution does not directly suggest processing interaction, and we emphasize some important limits on the utility of fitting theoretical distributions to data. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

It has been difficult to ascertain, though, that there actually is developmental growth in capacity that cannot be attributed to other developing factors. Here we assess the role of item familiarity.

Although letter knowledge played a special role in development between the ages of 6 and 8 years, children with adequate letter knowledge showed practically the same developmental growth in normalized functions for letters and unfamiliar characters. The results contribute to a growing body of evidence that the developmental improvement in working memory does not wholly stem from supporting processes such as encoding, mnemonic strategies, and knowledge.

For instance, some of the models have a parameter structure that was chosen to represent a speed-accuracy tradeoff, while others equate speed directly with response time. Also, several response-time models seem to be unclear as to the level of parametrization they represent. A hierarchical framework for modeling speed and accuracy on test items is presented as an alternative to these models. The framework allows a "plug-and-play approach" with alternative choices of models for the response and response-time distributions as well as the distributions of their parameters. Bayesian treatment of the framework with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation facilitates the approach. Use of the framework is illustrated for the choice of a normal-ogive response model, a lognormal model for the response times, and multivariate normal models for their parameters with Gibbs sampling from the joint posterior distribution.

Selecting between the two interpretations has been shown to be sensitive to both world-knowledge pressures (Farkas {\&} de Swart 2010) and contextual relevance (Grimm 2010). The principal semantic factor claimed to be involved is monotonicity direction (Sauerland, Anderssen {\&} Yatsushiro 2005; Spector 2007; Zweig 2009; Farkas {\&} de Swart 2010): upward monotone environments tend to select exclusive readings; downward monotone ones, inclusive readings. In four image verification experiments, we tested this claim and found support for the generalization. The effect of monotonicity direction, however, is small. Moreover we find that varying whether a plural is in the scope of a quantified description has a much larger effect on the prevalence of the exclusive interpretation. This suggests that monotonicity, though involved, is not a decisive factor in plural interpretation.},

abstract = {The source of syntactic island effects has been a topic of considerable debate within linguistics and psycholinguistics. Explanations fall into three basic categories: grammatical theories, which posit specific grammatical constraints that exclude extraction from islands; grounded theories, which posit grammaticized constraints that have arisen to adapt to constraints on learning or parsing; and reductionist theories, which analyze island effects as emergent consequences of nongrammatical constraints on the sentence parser, such as limited processing resources. In this article we present two studies designed to test a fundamental prediction of one of the most prominent reductionist theories: that the strength of island effects should vary across speakers as a function of individual differences in processing resources. We tested over three hundred native speakers of English on four different island-effect types (whether, complex NP, subject, and adjunct islands) using two different acceptability rating tasks (seven-point scale and magnitude estimation) and two different measures of working-memory capacity (serial recall and n-back). We find no evidence of a relationship between working-memory capacity and island effects using a variety of statistical analysis techniques, including resampling simulations. These results suggest that island effects are more likely to be due to grammatical constraints or grounded grammaticized constraints than to limited processing resources.},

abstract = {Efficient language processing may involve generating expectations about upcoming input. To investigate the extent to which prediction might facilitate reading, a large-scale survey provided cloze scores for all 2689 words in 55 different text passages. Highly predictable words were quite rare (5{\%} of content words), and most words had a more-expected competitor. An eye-tracking study showed sensitivity to cloze probability but no mis-prediction cost. Instead, the presence of a more-expected competitor was found to be facilitative in several measures. Further, semantic and morphosyntactic information was highly predictable even when word identity was not, and this information facilitated reading above and beyond the predictability of the full word form. The results are consistent with graded prediction but inconsistent with full lexical prediction. Implications for theories of prediction in language comprehension are discussed.},

abstract = {We investigated the time course of associative recognition using the response signal procedure, whereby a stimulus is presented and followed after a variable lag by a signal indicating that an immediate response is required. More specifically, we examined the effects of associative fan (the number of associations that an item has with other items in memory) on speed-accuracy tradeoff functions obtained in a previous response signal experiment involving briefly studied materials and in a new experiment involving well-learned materials. High fan lowered asymptotic accuracy or the rate of rise in accuracy across lags, or both. We developed an Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) model for the response signal procedure to explain these effects. The model assumes that high fan results in weak associative activation that slows memory retrieval, thereby decreasing the probability that retrieval finishes in time and producing a speed-accuracy tradeoff function. The ACT-R model provided an excellent account of the data, yielding quantitative fits that were as good as those of the best descriptive model for response signal data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The power fallacy refers to the misconception that what holds on average –across an ensemble of hypothetical experiments– also holds for each case individually. According to the fallacy, high-power experiments always yield more informative data than do low-power experiments. Here we expose the fallacy with concrete examples, demonstrating that a particular outcome from a high-power experiment can be completely uninformative, whereas a particular outcome from a low-power experiment can be highly informative. Although power is useful in planning an experiment, it is less useful—and sometimes even misleading—for making inferences from observed data. To make inferences from data, we recommend the use of likelihood ratios or Bayes factors, which are the extension of likelihood ratios beyond point hypotheses. These methods of inference do not average over hypothetical replications of an experiment, but instead condition on the data that have actually been observed. In this way, likelihood ratios and Bayes factors rationally quantify the evidence that a particular data set provides for or against the null or any other hypothesis.},

abstract = {Many comprehension theories assert that increasing the distance between elements participating in a linguistic relation (e.g., a verb and a noun phrase argument) increases the difficulty of establishing that relation during on-line comprehension. Such locality effects are expected to increase reading times and are thought to reveal properties and limitations of the short-term memory system that supports comprehension. Despite their theoretical importance and putative ubiquity, however, evidence for on-line locality effects is quite narrow linguistically and methodologically: It is restricted almost exclusively to self-paced reading of complex structures involving a particular class of syntactic relation. We present 4 experiments (2 self-paced reading and 2 eyetracking experiments) that demonstrate locality effects in the course of establishing subject-verb dependencies; locality effects are seen even in materials that can be read quickly and easily. These locality effects are observable in the earliest possible eye-movement measures and are of much shorter duration than previously reported effects. To account for the observed empirical patterns, we outline a processing model of the adaptive control of button pressing and eye movements. This model makes progress toward the goal of eliminating linking assumptions between memory constructs and empirical measures in favor of explicit theories of the coordinated control of motor responses and parsing.

two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion,
called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information
lost and gained in changing from clustering to clustering . The basic
properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds
of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the
new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric
on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability
of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter
properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing
comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we
present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is
the only “sensible” criterion for comparing partitions that is both
aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence,
we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there
is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies
the above two desirable properties and is bounded.},

From there we proceed to lexical processing, where we summarize Rayner's work on effects of word frequency, length, predictability, and the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Next, we turn to syntactic and discourse processing, covering the well-known garden-path model of parsing and briefly reviewing studies of pronoun resolution and inferencing. The next section shifts from language to visual cognition and reviews research which makes use of eye movement techniques to investigate object and scene processing. Next, we summarize Rayner and colleagues' approach to computational modeling, with a description of the E-Z Reader model linking attention and lexical processing to eye movement control. The final section discusses the issues Rayner and his colleagues were focused on most recently and considers how Rayner's legacy will continue into the future.},

In Experiment 1, although a comma at the end of a clause facilitated overall reading times for the sentence, first pass times were longer at the end of comma-marked clauses than clauses without a comma (or the same material in clause medial position). The data supported the dwell time hypothesis which claims that readers pause at punctuation marks. To explore the possibility that dwell time/wrap-up effects are really due to pausing at the ends of intonational phrases, Experiment 2 tested non-redundant punctuation in structures where a comma corresponds to an obligatory intonational phrase boundary in speech. The intonation hypothesis was supported for vocatives and parentheticals but not for non-restrictive relative clauses. Relative clauses were further investigated in Experiment 3. Overall, the data were consistent with the intonation explanation for wrap-up effects but only if it is assumed that non-restrictive relatives and other asides receive less attention than do other parts of a sentence. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Event-related potentials (ERPs) and modeling of their neural sources, however, indicated that the initial sensory input to striate cortex at 50-55 milliseconds after the stimulus was not modulated by attention. The earliest facilitation of attended signals was observed in extrastriate visual areas, at 70-75 milliseconds. We hypothesize that the striate cortex modulation found with fMRI may represent a delayed, re-entrant feedback from higher visual areas or a sustained biasing of striate cortical neurons during attention.

The focus of these efforts has changed significantly in the past decade. As a result of changes in models of short-term working memory (ST-WM) and developments in models of sentence comprehension, the effort to relate entire components of an ST-WM system, such as those in the model developed by Baddeley (Nature Reviews Neuroscience 4: 829-839, 2003) to sentence comprehension has largely been replaced by an effort to relate more specific mechanisms found in modern models of ST-WM to memory processes that support one aspect of sentence comprehension--the assignment of syntactic structure (parsing) and its use in determining sentence meaning (interpretation) during sentence comprehension. In this article, we present the historical background to recent studies of the memory mechanisms that support parsing and interpretation and review recent research into this relation. We argue that the results of this research do not converge on a set of mechanisms derived from ST-WM that apply to parsing and interpretation. We argue that the memory mechanisms supporting parsing and interpretation have features that characterize another memory system that has been postulated to account for skilled performance-long-term working memory. We propose a model of the relation of different aspects of parsing and interpretation to ST-WM and long-term working memory.},

abstract = {Scanpaths, sequences of fixations of the eyes, have historically played an important role in eyetracking research but their use has remained highly limited until recently. Here, we summarize earlier research and argue that scanpaths are a valuable source of information for reading research, specifically in the study of sentence comprehension. We also discuss a freely available, open source scanpath analysis method that we used to evaluate theoretical claims about human parsing and about how the parser guides the eyes during reading. This scanpath analysis is shown to yield new information that was missed when traditional approaches were used to study theories about eye guidance during garden-pathing. We also show how relatively subtle scanpath effects can be detected when we report the scanpath analysis of a large eyetracking corpus. In sum, we argue that scanpath analyses are likely to serve as an increasingly important tool in reading research, and perhaps also in other areas where eyetracking is used, e.g., in studies using the visual world paradigm.},

Observed saccadic response times in stop failure trials were longer than predicted by Logan and Cowan's (1984) race model. Saccadic response time and amplitude decreased with the time between stop signal presentation and saccade execution, suggesting an inhibitory effect between the stop signal and the go signal processes that is not compatible with an independent race assumption.

Previous research (Traxler, Pickering, {\&} Clifton, 1998; Van Gompel, Pickering, {\&} Traxler, 2001) has shown that globally ambiguous sentences are easier to process than disambiguated sentences, suggesting that competition does not explain processing difficulty. However, the disambiguation in these studies was delayed relative to the initial point of ambiguity, so they do not rule out models which claim that competition is very short-lasting. The current experiments show that globally ambiguous sentences are easier to process than disambiguated sentences even when the disambiguation is immediate. Furthermore, globally ambiguous sentences are no harder to process than syntactically unambiguous sentences. We argue that the results are inconsistent with currently implemented constraint-based competition models, and support variable-choice reanalysis models such as the unrestricted race model.},

@phdthesis{Keller2000,
abstract = {This thesis deals with gradience in grammar, i.e., with the fact that some linguistic structures are not fully acceptable or unacceptable, but receive gradient linguistic judgments. The importance of gradient data for linguistic theory has been recognized at least since Chomskys Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory. However, systematic empirical studies of gradience are largely absent, and none of the major theoretical frameworks is designed to account for gradient data. The present thesis addresses both questions. In the experimental part of the thesis (Chapters 35), we present a set of magnitude estimation experiments investigating gradience in grammar. The experiments deal with unaccusativity/unergativity, extraction, binding, word order, and gapping. They cover all major modules of syntactic theory, and draw on data from three languages (English, German, and Greek). In the theoretical part of thesis (Chapters 6 and 7), we use these experimental results to motivate a model of gradience in grammar. This model is a variant of Optimality Theory, and explains gradience in terms of the competition of ranked, violable linguistic constraints. The experimental studies in this thesis deliver two main results. First, they demonstrate that an experimental investigation of gradient phenomena can advance linguistic theory by uncovering acceptability distinctions that have gone unnoticed in the theoretical literature. An experimental approach can also settle data disputes that result from the informal data collection techniques typically employed in theoretical linguistics, which are not well-suited to investigate the behavior of gradient linguistic data. Second, we identify a set of general properties of gradient data that seem to be valid for a wide range of syntactic phenomena and across languages. (a) Linguistic constraints are ranked, in the sense that some constraint violations lead to a greater degree of unacceptability than others. (b) Constraint violations are cumulative, i.e., the degree of unacceptability of a structure increases with the number of constraints it violates. (c) Two constraint types can be distinguished experimentally: soft constraints lead to mild unacceptability when violated, while hard constraint violations trigger serious unacceptability. (d) The hard/soft distinction can be diagnosed by testing for effects from the linguistic context; context effects only occur for soft constraints; hard constraints are immune to contextual variation. (e) The soft/hard distinction is crosslinguistically stable. In the theoretical part of the thesis, we develop a model of gradient grammaticality that borrows central concepts from Optimality Theory, a competition-based grammatical framework. We propose an extension, Linear Optimality Theory, motivated by our experimental results on constraint ranking and the cumulativity of violations. The core assumption of our model is that the relative grammaticality of a structure is determined by the weighted sum of the violations it incurs. We show that the parameters of the model (the constraint weights), can be estimated using the least square method, a standard model fitting algorithm. Furthermore, we prove that standard Optimality Theory is a special case of Linear Optimality Theory. To test the validity of Linear Optimality Theory, we use it to model data from the experimental part of the thesis, including data on extraction, gapping, and word order. For all data sets, a high model fit is obtained and it is demonstrated that the models predictions generalize to unseen data. On a theoretical level, our modeling results show that certain properties of gradient data (the hard/soft distinction, context effects, and crosslinguistic effects) do not have to be stipulated, but follow from core assumptions of Linear Optimality Theory.},

This hypothesis will be challenged here on empirical grounds from the viewpoint of multiple initial embedding of clauses. The data come from the British National Corpus, Brown, LOB, and philological scholarship. The results extend to several other 'Standard Average European' (SAE) languages like Finnish, German, Latin, and Swedish. There is a precise quantitative constraint on the degree of initial clausal embedding, and that limit is two. In double initial embeddings, a qualitative constraint prescribes that typically the highest embedded clause is an if-clause. The lower embedded clause should be the sentential subject of the if-clause. Here is a real example of a maximally complex, prototypical, initial clausal embedding in mainstream SAE: [(Main) [(Init-1) If [(Init-2) what is tantamount to dictatorship...] continues in a union] it can...] (LOB). Multiple initial self-embeddings are prohibited. Adapted from the source document},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This paper presents three experiments that investigate the relationship between gradient and binary judgments of grammaticality. In the first two experiments, two different groups of participants judged sentences by the method of magnitude estimation and by the method of speeded grammaticality judgments in a single session. The two experiments involved identical sentence materials but they differed in the order in which the two procedures were applied. The results show a high correlation between the magnitude estimation data and the speeded grammaticality judgments data, both within a session and across the two sessions. The third experiment was a questionnaire study in which participants judged the same sentences as either grammatical or ungrammatical without time pressure. This experiment yielded results quite similar to those of the other two experiments. Thus gradient and binary judgments both provide valuable and reliable sources for linguistic theory when assessed in an experimentally controlled way. We present a model based on Signal Detection Theory which specifies how gradient grammaticality scores are mapped to binary grammaticality judgments. Finally, we compare our experimental results to existing corpus data in order to inquire into the relationship between grammaticality and frequency of usage.},

abstract = {We present experimental support for the view that fine-grained statistical information may play a crucial role in the processing of centre-embedded linguistic structure. Using both offline and online methods, we show that the processing of pronominal object-relative clauses is influenced by the frequency of co-occurrence of the word combinations (chunks) forming the clause. We use materials that are controlled for capacity-based factors that have been previously shown to influence comprehension of relative clauses. The results suggest that, other factors being equal, the frequency of the word chunk forming the clause affects processing difficulty. Analyses of the data indicate that the results cannot be explained by differential access to individual lexical items. Following recent constructivist approaches, we argue that frequency of co-occurrence influences the chunking mechanism by which multiword sequences may become fused into processing units that are easier to access.},

abstract = {We present interpretation-based processing-a theory of sentence processing that builds a syntactic and a semantic representation for a sentence and assigns an interpretation to the sentence as soon as possible. That interpretation can further participate in comprehension and in lexical processing and is vital for relating the sentence to the prior discourse. Our theory offers a unified account of the processing of literal sentences, metaphoric sentences, and sentences containing semantic illusions. It also explains how text can prime lexical access. We show that word literality is a matter of degree and that the speed and quality of comprehension depend both on how similar words are to their antecedents in the preceding text and how salient the sentence is with respect to the preceding text. Interpretation-based processing also reconciles superficially contradictory findings about the difference in processing times for metaphors and literals. The theory has been implemented in ACT-R [Anderson and Lebiere, The Atomic Components of Thought, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates Publishers, Mahwah, NJ, 1998]. {\textcopyright} 2003 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

Such voice mismatches are not allowed in any other kind of ellipsis, such as sluicing and other clausal ellipses. These latter facts appear to indicate that the identity relation in ellipsis is sensitive to syntactic form, not merely to semantic form. The VP- ellipsis facts fall into place if the head that determines voice is external to the phrase being elided, here argued to be vP; such an account can only be framed in approaches that allow syntactic features to be separated from the heads on which they are morphologically realized. Alternatives to this syntactic, articulated view of ellipsis and voice either undergenerate or overgenerate.},

abstract = {On-line comprehension studies of flexible word-order languages find that noncanonical ('scrambled') structures induce more difficulty than canonical structures e.g., Hyona {\&} Hujanen, Q. J. Exp. Psychol. 50A (1997) 841-858, with this difference being attributed to the structural complexity/infrequency of these forms. However, by presenting sentences in isolation, most existing studies have not examined the extent to which processing patterns can be explained by discourse factors. In Finnish, an articleless flexible word-order language with canonical SVO order, word order can be used to encode the given/new distinctions: OVS marks the object as given and the subject as new; SVO is more flexible, being used in multiple contexts. Thus, the observed dispreference for noncanonical orders in previous work may arise from additional presuppositions needed to understand them out of context cf. Crain {\&} Steedman, Natural Language Parsing, (1985), 320-358. Two experiments were conducted to examine these issues in Finnish. Experiment 1 used a self-paced reading task to show that the usual difficulty associated with noncanonical constructions is partially alleviated in the presence of appropriate discourse contexts. In Experiment 2, the eye gaze of listeners was tracked as they heard spoken descriptions of scenes, so as to test whether specific on-line referential processes are involved in SVO/OVS comprehension: Upon hearing an OV... sequence, Finnish listeners should expect the upcoming noun to be discourse-new, whereas an SV... sequence makes no such prediction. The results confirmed these predictions. As compared to SVO, OVS sentences showed anticipatory eye movements to a discourse-new referent at the second noun onset, even before participants had enough acoustic information to recognize this word. Our findings illustrate that in a flexible word-order language, a noncanonical order can result in anticipatory processes regarding the discourse status of a yet-to-be-heard constituent.},

We argue that it is important to separate effects that reflect the initial antecedent retrieval process from those that reflect later processes. We present results from five reading comprehension experiments. Both the current results and previous evidence support the hypothesis that agreement features and structural constraints immediately constrain the antecedent retrieval process for pronoun interpretation. Occasional sensitivity to grammatically-illicit antecedents may be due to repair processes triggered when the initial retrieval fails to return a grammatical antecedent.},

To demonstrate this, this article investigates an unusual instance of dependency resolution, the processing of negative and positive polarity items, and confirms a surprising prediction of the cue-based retrieval model: Partialcue matches-which constitute a kind of similarity-based interference-can give rise to the intrusion of ungrammatical retrieval candidates, leading to both processing slow-downs and even errors of judgment that take the form of illusions of grammaticality in patently ungrammatical structures. A notable achievement is that good quantitative fits are achieved without adjusting the key model parameters.},

Two such models (Reader: Just and Carpenter, 1980; EMMA: Salvucci, 2001) are briefly described and a third (E-Z Reader: Reichle et al., 1998) is described in detail. The chapter then reviews simulations completed using the E-Z Reader model to evaluate the plausibility and generality of its assumptions, and to examine various reading phenomena. These simulations are consistent with the hypothesis that attention is allocated serially during reading.},

Also, for these participants, foveal load modulated preview benefit regardless of fixation durations on the foveal word.

abstract = {For lexical-gustatory synaesthetes, words trigger automatic, associated food sensations (e.g., for JB, the word slope tastes of over-ripe melon). Our study tests two claims about this unusual condition: that synaesthetic tastes are associated with abstract levels of word representation (concepts/lemmas), and that the first tastes to crystallise in early development are those triggered by food-names (e.g., apple tastes of apple; Simner {\{}{\&}{\}} Ward, 2006). This concept/lemma-based proposal is difficult to immediately reconcile with the finding that non-words may also generate tastes (Ward, Simner, {\{}{\&}{\}} Auyeung, 2005), since non-words have no concept/lemma representations. We manipulated the characteristics of non-words to provide three types of evidence that non-word tastes in fact stem from real word neighbours: Non-words with neighbours (e.g., keach) are more likely to generate tastes than those with no neighbours (e.g., vilps); pseudo-homophone non-words that are orthographically close to real words (e.g., peeple) are more likely to generate tastes than those that are more distant (baybee); and finally, the tastes of non-words are less consistent, and less intense, than those of real words. Additionally, we test the hypothesis that synaesthetic tastes develop initially from food-names by showing that non-words are more intensely flavoured if they are homophonic with food-names (e.g., toffie) versus non-foods (e.g., peeple). From this we conclude that synaesthetic tastes develop from food-names, and that tasty non-words do not challenge a concept/lemma-based account of lexical-gustatory synaesthesia.},

@article{PatilVasishthLewis:2016,
abstract = {It has been proposed that in online sentence comprehension the dependency between a reflexive pronoun such as himself/herself and its antecedent is resolved using exclusively syntactic constraints. Under this strictly syntactic search account, Principle A of the binding theory-which requires that the antecedent c-command the reflexive within the same clause that the reflexive occurs in-constrains the parser's search for an antecedent. The parser thus ignores candidate antecedents that might match agreement features of the reflexive (e.g., gender) but are ineligible as potential antecedents because they are in structurally illicit positions. An alternative possibility accords no special status to structural constraints: in addition to using Principle A, the parser also uses non-structural cues such as gender to access the antecedent. According to cue-based retrieval theories of memory (e.g., Lewis and Vasishth, 2005), the use of non-structural cues should result in increased retrieval times and occasional errors when candidates partially match the cues, even if the candidates are in structurally illicit positions. In this paper, we first show how the retrieval processes that underlie the reflexive binding are naturally realized in the Lewis and Vasishth (2005) model. We present the predictions of the model under the assumption that both structural and non-structural cues are used during retrieval, and provide a critical analysis of previous empirical studies that failed to find evidence for the use of non-structural cues, suggesting that these failures may be Type II errors. We use this analysis and the results of further modeling to motivate a new empirical design that we use in an eye tracking study. The results of this study confirm the key predictions of the model concerning the use of non-structural cues, and are inconsistent with the strictly syntactic search account. These results present a challenge for theories advocating the infallibility of the human parser in the case of reflexive resolution, and provide support for the inclusion of agreement features such as gender in the set of retrieval cues.},

abstract = {Theoretical linguistics traditionally relies on linguistic intuitions such as grammaticality judgments for data. But the massive growth of language technologies has made the spontaneous use of language in natural settings a rich and easily accessible alternative source of data. Moreover, studies of usage as well as intuitive judgments have shown that linguistic intuitions of grammaticality are deeply flawed, because (1) they seriously underestimate the space of grammatical possibility by ignoring the effects of multiple conflicting formal, semantic, and contextual constraints, and (2) they may reflect probability instead of grammaticality. Both of these points are richly exemplified by studies of the English dative alternation (Green 1971; Gries 2003, 2005; Fellbaum 2005; Bresnan {\&} Nikitina 2003; Bresnan, Cueni, Ni- kitina {\&} Baayen in press; Lapata 1999; Bresnan {\&} Hay 2006; Hay {\&} Bresnan 2006), which is the linguistic domain of the present study. The present study discusses two experiments following up Bresnan et al. (in press). The first indicates that the “soft” generalizations found in corpus studies of the dative alternation reappear in subjects' intuitions of gram- maticality in context, and that language users have substantial knowledge on the basis of these generalizations of what others are going to say (mean- ing here the choice of syntactic structure to convey the message). The sec- ond experiment shows that rare constructions that have been considered ungrammatical by many linguistic theorists are judged natural by speakers when the appropriate soft conditions are met. Intuitive contrasts in gram- maticality that many linguists have reported seem to reflect probabilities rather than categorical constraints.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure p D for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general p D approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding p D to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

abstract = {Perceptual decision making has been successfully modeled as a process of evidence accumulation up to a threshold. In order to maximize the rewards earned for correct responses in tasks with response deadlines, participants should collapse decision thresholds dynamically during each trial so that a decision is reached before the deadline. This strategy ensures on-time responding, though at the cost of reduced accuracy, since slower decisions are based on lower thresholds and less net evidence later in a trial (compared to a constant threshold). Frazier {\&} Yu (2008) showed that the normative rate of threshold reduction depends on deadline delays and on participants' uncertainty about these delays. Participants should start collapsing decision thresholds earlier when making decisions under shorter deadlines (for a given level of timing uncertainty) or when timing uncertainty is higher (for a given deadline). We tested these predictions using human participants in a random dot motion discrimination task. Each participant was tested in free-response, short deadline (800 ms), and long deadline conditions (1000 ms). Contrary to optimal-performance predictions, the resulting empirical function relating accuracy to response time (RT) in deadline conditions did not decline to chance level near the deadline; nor did the slight decline we typically observed relate to measures of endogenous timing uncertainty. Further, although this function did decline slightly with increasing RT, the decline was explainable by the best-fitting parameterization of Ratcliff's diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978), whose parameters are constant within trials. Our findings suggest that at the very least, typical decision durations are too short for participants to adapt decision parameters within trials.},

The goal was to theoretically examine these separate strategies and to apply them conjointly to the same set of participants. The empirical phases were carried out within an extension of an established experimental design called the double factorial paradigm (e.g., Townsend {\&} Nozawa Journal of Mathematical Psychology 39, 321-359, 1995). That paradigm, based on response times, permits assessments of architecture (parallel vs. serial processing), stopping rule (exhaustive vs. minimum time), and workload capacity, all within the same blocks of trials. The paradigm introduced by Shaw and colleagues uses a statistic formally analogous to that of the double factorial paradigm, but based on accuracy rather than response times. We demonstrate that the accuracy measure cannot discriminate between parallel and serial processing. Nonetheless, the class of models supported by the accuracy data possesses a suitable interpretation within the same set of models supported by the response-time data. The supported model, consistent across individuals, is parallel and has limited capacity, with the participants employing the appropriate stopping rule for the experimental setting.},

Here, we present two experiments suggesting that lexical prediction is influenced by top-down comprehension strategies, and that lexical predictions are not always generated automatically as a function of the preceding context. In Experiment 1 (N = 24), participants read predictable and unpredictable sentence-final words while EEG was recorded from the scalp. When comparing two different sets of task instructions, the neural effects of cloze probability were enhanced when predictive processing was emphasized. In Experiment 2 (N = 252), participants read predictable and unpredictable sentence continuations in a self-paced reading task, and the overall validity of predictive cues was manipulated across groups using a separate set of filler sentences. There was a linear relationship between the benefits of a constraining sentence context and the global validity of predictive cues. Critically, no reading time benefits were observed as prediction validity approached zero. These results provide important constraints for theories of anticipatory language processing, while calling into question prior assumptions about the automaticity of lexical prediction.},

We assume that such location errors in the slots model occur when the feature information for an item in one location is swapped with the feature information for an item in another location. We show that such a model predicts two factors that will influence the extent to which location errors occur: (1) whether the test item changes to an "external" item not presented at study, or to an "internal" item presented at another location during study, and (2) the number of items in the study array.

abstract = {Simulation studies are computer experiments that involve creating data by pseudorandom sampling. The key strength of simulation studies is the ability to understand the behaviour of statistical methods because some 'truth' (usually some parameter/s of interest) is known from the process of generating the data. This allows us to consider properties of methods, such as bias. While widely used, simulation studies are often poorly designed, analysed and reported. This tutorial outlines the rationale for using simulation studies and offers guidance for design, execution, analysis, reporting and presentation. In particular, this tutorial provides: a structured approach for planning and reporting simulation studies, which involves defining aims, data-generating mechanisms, estimands, methods and performance measures ('ADEMP'); coherent terminology for simulation studies; guidance on coding simulation studies; a critical discussion of key performance measures and their estimation; guidance on structuring tabular and graphical presentation of results; and new graphical presentations. With a view to describing recent practice, we review 100 articles taken from Volume 34 of Statistics in Medicine that included at least one simulation study and identify areas for improvement.},

Supervision, measured as specific switch costs, was not related to intelligence, but general switch costs were moderately correlated to the reasoning factor.

We show how the Bayes factor hypothesis test can quantify evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, and how the prior specification for the correlation coefficient can be used to define a broad range of tests that address complementary questions. Specifically, we show how the prior specification can be adjusted to create a two-sided test, a one-sided test, a sensitivity analysis, and a replication test.},

abstract = {We reexamine the empirical record of the comprehension abilities of
Broca's aphasic patients. We establish clear, commonly accepted,
selection criteria and obtain a pool of results. We then subject
these results to a detailed statistical analysis and show that these
patients comprehend certain canonical sentences (actives, subject
relatives, and clefts with agentive predicates) at above-chance levels,
whereas comprehension of sentences that contain deviations from canonicity
(passives, object-gap relatives, and clefts) is distinct and is at
chance. That the latter is the case, and patients indeed guess at
such structures, we show by comparing the distribution of individual
results in passive comprehension to that of a model for such guessing-an
analogous series of tosses of an unbiased coin. The two distributions
are virtually identical. We conclude that the group's performance
is stable, and well-delineated, despite intersubject variation whose
source is now identified. This means that certain comprehension tests
may not always be used for the diagnosis of individual patients,
but they do characterize the group. It also means that group studies
are not just a valid option in neuropsychology; they are a must,
since demonstrations like ours indiciate very clearly that single-case
studies may be misleading. As we show, the findings from any one
patient, without the context of a group, may give a distorted picture
of the pathological reality. Our conclusions thus promote studies
of groups of brain-damaged patients as a central tool for the investigation
of brain/behavior relations.},

Easy C-in-O searches and difficult O-in-C searches are often associated with parallel and serial search, respectively. Here, the time course of visual search was measured for both tasks with speed-accuracy methods. The time courses of the 2 tasks were similar and independent of display size. New probabilistic parallel and serial search models and sophisticated-guessing variants made predictions about time course and accuracy of visual search. The probabilistic parallel model provided an excellent account of the data, but the serial model did not. Asymptotic search accuracies and display size effects were consistent with a signal-detection analysis, with lower variance encoding of Cs than Os. In the absence of eye movements, asymmetric visual search, long considered an example of serial deployment of covert attention, is qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with parallel search processes.},

There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 {\%}) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.},

When arguments of verbs appear at the point where a syntactic violation is detected, a centroparietal positivity occurs, peaking at 600 ms after the presentation of the stimulus (P600), as is consistent with other types of syntactic anomalies. However, nonarguments in similar sentences fail to elicit the same response. For example, the reflexive in "John's brothers like himself" is in an argument position and elicits the P600 when compared to its grammatical counterpart. The nonargument, participating in the same type of mismatch, "John's brothers like Bill and himself," does not elicit the same positivity. This provides evidence that there are two processes involved in parsing this binding construction, one syntactic and another as yet unidentified, perhaps involving meaning or pragmatics.},

Although research questions are frequently conceived with broad inquiry in mind, most regression methods are limited in comprehensively evaluating how observed behaviors are related to each other. Quantile regression is a largely unknown yet well-suited analytic technique similar to traditional regression analysis, but allows for a more systematic approach to understanding complex associations among observed phenomena in the psychological sciences. Data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988/2000 are used to illustrate how quantile regression overcomes the limitations of average associations in linear regression by showing that psychological well-being and sex each differentially relate to reading achievement depending on one's level of reading achievement.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome-wide experiments only rarely show resounding success in yielding genes associated with complex polygenic disorders. We evaluate 49 obesity-related genome-wide experiments with publicly available findings including microarray, genetics, proteomics and gene knock-down from human, mouse, rat and worm, in terms of their ability to rediscover a comprehensive set of genes previously found to be causally associated or having variants associated with obesity. RESULTS: Individual experiments show poor predictive ability for rediscovering known obesity-associated genes. We show that intersecting the results of experiments significantly improves the sensitivity, specificity and precision of the prediction of obesity-associated genes. We create an integrative model that statistically significantly outperforms all 49 individual genome-wide experiments. We find that genes known to be associated with obesity are significantly implicated in more obesity-related experiments and use this to provide a list of genes that we predict to have the highest likelihood of association for obesity. The approach described here can include any number and type of genome-wide experiments and might be useful for other complex polygenic disorders as well.},

abstract = {Frequently the analysis of large experimental datasets reveals significant interactions that are difficult to interpret within the theoretical framework guiding the research. Some of these interactions are actually spurious artifacts arising from the presence of unspecified nonlinear main effects and statistically dependent covariates in the statistical model. Importantly, often such nonlinear main effects may be quite compatible (or, at least, may not be incompatible) with the current theoretical framework. In the present literature this issue has only been studied in terms of correlated (linearly dependent) covariates. Here we generalize to nonlinear main effects (i.e., main effects of arbitrary shape) and dependent covariates. We propose a novel nonparametric method to test for ambiguous or spurious interactions where present parametric methods fail. We illustrate the method with re-analyses of eye-movements, specifically of fixation durations and locations, during reading of natural sentences.},

abstract = {A sizeable literature exists on the use of frequentist power analysis to facilitate the design of informative experiments. In contrast, there is almost no literature that discusses the design of experiments when Bayes factors (BFs) are used as a measure of evidence. Here we explore Bayes Factor Design Analysis (BFDA) as a useful tool to design studies for maximum effi-ciency and informativeness. We elaborate on three possible BF designs, (a) a fixed-n design, (b) an open-ended Sequential Bayes Factor (SBF) design, where researchers can test after each participant and can stop data collection whenever there is strong evidence for either H 1 or H 0 , and (c) a modified SBF design that defines a maximal sample size where data collection is stopped regardless of the current state of evidence. We demonstrate how the properties of each design (i.e., expected strength of evidence, expected sample size, expected probability of misleading evidence, expected probability of weak evidence) can be evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and equip researchers with the necessary information to compute their own Bayesian design analyses.},

abstract = {Sternberg's additive factor method was generalized to apply to tasks involving both serial and concurrent processing. The generalization is based on the critical path method of scheduling. The effects on reaction time of factors prolonging separate processes in a task are discussed: in general these effects are interactions of a simple form. Reaction times can be used to deduce, in part, the schedule of the mental processes in a task, including their order of execution. Bounds on process durations can be derived. Often there are redundant equations so the method can be easily rejected if it does not apply. A dual task experiment by Greenwald was analyzed. In the task subjects were presented with two stimuli and made aresponse to each under high and low compatibility conditions. Two bottlenecks in processing were located: (a) Subjects make only one decision at a time, in accordance with single channel theory, although the high compatibility condition may be an exception; (b) there is a mental process which takes longer when the stimuli conflict. The decisions about the two stimuli probably change places in the schedula when compatibility is changed.},

abstract = {Ongoing debate surrounds the capacity and characteristics of the focus of attention. The present study investigates whether a pattern of larger recency effects and smaller primacy effects reported in previous working memory studies is specific to task conditions used in those studies, or generalizes across manipulations of task-demand. Two experiments varied task-demands by requiring participants to remember lists of letters and to then respond to a subsequent two-item probe by indicating either the item that was presented later in the list (judgment of recency) or the item was presented earlier (judgment of primacy). Analyses tested the prediction that a WM task emphasizing later items in a list (judgment of recency) would encourage exaggerated recency effects and attenuated primacy effects, while a task emphasizing earlier items (judgment of primacy) would encourage exaggerated primacy effects and attenuated recency effects. Behavioral results from two experiments confirmed this prediction. In contrast to past studies, fMRI contrasts revealed no brain regions where activity was significantly altered by the presence of recency items in the probe, for either task condition. However, presence of the primacy item in the probe significantly influenced activity in frontal lobe brain regions linked to active maintenance, but the location and direction of activation changes varied as a function of task instructions. In sum, two experiments demonstrate that the behavioral and neural signatures of WM, specifically related to primacy and recency effects, are dependent on task-demands. Findings are discussed as they inform models of the structure and capacity of WM.},

The hypotheses were represented by 3 models of serial recall: the primacy model, the SIMPLE (scale-independent memory, perception, and learning) model, and the SOB (serial order in a box) model, respectively. The models were fit to 2 experiments investigating the effect of filled delays between items at encoding or at recall. Short delays between items, filled with articulatory suppression, led to massive impairment of memory relative to a no-delay baseline. Extending the delays had little additional effect, suggesting that the passage of time alone does not cause forgetting. Adding a choice reaction task in the delay periods to block attention-based rehearsal did not change these results. The interference-based SOB fit the data best; the primacy model overpredicted the effect of lengthening delays, and SIMPLE was unable to explain the effect of delays at encoding. The authors conclude that purely temporal views of forgetting are inadequate.},

One explanation may be that extracting the statistical descriptors requires parallel access to all the information in the array. Consistent with this claim, we found an advantage for simultaneous over successive presentation when the total time available was matched. However, the advantage was small; parallel access facilitates statistical processing without being essential. Evidence that statistical processing is automatic when attention is distributed over a display came from the finding that there was no decrement in accuracy relative to single-task performance when mean judgments were made concurrently with another task that required distributed or global attention.},

abstract = {Short-term memory (STM) refers to the capacity-limited retention of information over a brief period of time, and working memory (WM) refers to the manipulation and use of that information to guide behavior. In recent years it has become apparent that STM and WM interact and overlap with other cognitive processes, including attention (the selection of a subset of information for further processing) and long-term memory (LTM-the encoding and retention of an effectively unlimited amount of information for a much longer period of time). Broadly speaking, there have been two classes of memory models: systems models, which posit distinct stores for STM and LTM (Atkinson and Shiffrin, 1968; Baddeley and Hitch, 1974); and state-based models, which posit a common store with different activation states corresponding to STM and LTM (Cowan, 1995; McElree, 1996; Oberauer, 2002). In this paper, we will focus on state-based accounts of STM. First, we will consider several theoretical models that postulate, based on considerable behavioral evidence, that information in STM can exist in multiple representational states. We will then consider how neural data from recent studies of STM can inform and constrain these theoretical models. In the process we will highlight the inferential advantage of multivariate, information-based analyses of neuroimaging data (fMRI and electroencephalography (EEG)) over conventional activation-based analysis approaches (Postle, in press). We will conclude by addressing lingering questions regarding the fractionation of STM, highlighting differences between the attention to information vs. the retention of information during brief memory delays.},

observations are at odds with this view. Only 10-20{\%} of the synapses

half of all synapses derive from cells in layer VI of visual cortex;
roughly one third are inhibitory and GABAergic, derived either from
interneurons or from cells of the nearby perigeniculate nucleus.
Most of the remaining synapses probably derive from cholinergic,
noradrenergic, and serotonergic sites within the brainstem reticular
formation. Moreover, recent biophysical studies have revealed several
ionic currents present in virtually all thalamic neurons. One is
a Ca2+-dependent K+ current underlying the afterhyperpolarization
(or the IAHP), which may last up to 100-200 ms following an action
potential. Activation of the IAHP leads to spike frequency adaptation
in response to a sustained, suprathreshold input. Intracellular recordings
from other neuronal preparations have shown that the IAHP can be
blocked by noradrenaline or acetylcholine, leading to an increased
cellular excitability. Another ionic current results from a voltage-
and time-dependent Ca2+ conductance that produces a low threshold
spike. Activation of this conductance transforms a geniculate neuron
from a state of faithful relay of information to one of bursting
behavior that bears little relationship to the activity of its retinal
afferents. We propose that state-dependent gating of geniculate relay
cells, which may represent part of the neuronal substrate involved
in certain forms of selective visual attention, can be effected through
at least three different mechanisms: conventional GABAergic inhibition,
which is largely controlled via brainstem and cortical afferents
through interneurons and perigeniculate cells; the IAHP, which is
controlled via noradrenergic and cholinergic afferents from the brainstem
reticular formation; and the low threshold spike, which may be controlled
by GABAergic inputs, cholinergic inputs, and/or the corticogeniculate
input, although other possibilities also exist. Furthermore, it seems
likely that gating functions involving the corticogeniculate pathway
are suited to attentional processes within the visual domain (e.g.,
saccadic suppression), whereas brainstem inputs seem more likely
to have more global effects that switch attention between sensory
systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {We propose two principles that facilitate integration of two relational premises in spatial reasoning. Integration is easier if the anaphor in the second premise, P2, bears the role of the relatum (relatum = given). Moreover, integration is easier if, in P2, the anaphor is mentioned before the new element (given-new). In premises with canonical word order (grammatical subjects mentioned first), these principles always conflict with one another. In topicalized statements mentioning the prepositional phrase first, the two principles work in tandem. By varying word order, we tested the two principles by measuring P2 comprehension times. Comprehension times indicated that integration was easiest when P2 obeyed both principles and most difficult when both principles were violated. Canonical premises were of intermediate difficulty. This pattern emerged regardless of whether the anaphor was a definite description or a pronoun.},

The model is a composition of two first-level models for dichotomous responses and response times along with multivariate normal models for their item and person parameters. It is shown how the item parameters can easily be estimated using Fisher's identity. To test the fit of the model, Lagrange multiplier tests of the assumptions of subpopulation invariance of the item parameters (i.e., no differential item functioning), the shape of the response functions, and three different types of conditional independence were derived. Simulation studies were used to show the feasibility of the estimation and testing procedures and to estimate the power and Type I error rate of the latter. In addition, the procedures were applied to an empirical data set from a computerized adaptive test of language comprehension.},

Study 1 used a gated sentence completion task to assess which alternative interpretations are dominant as the relative clause unfolds; Study 2 compared reading times in object relative clauses containing different animacy configurations to unambiguous passive controls; and Study 3 related completion data and reading data. The results showed that comprehension difficulty was modulated by animacy configuration and voice (active vs. passive). These differences were well correlated with the availability of alternative interpretations as the relative clause unfolds, as revealed by the completion data. In contrast to approaches arguing that comprehension difficulty stems from syntactic complexity, these results suggest that semantic indeterminacy is a major source of comprehension difficulty in object relative clauses. Results are consistent with constraint-based approaches to ambiguity resolution and bring new insights into previously identified sources of difficulty. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Simultaneously ambiguous and incoherent anaphors elicited an ERP pattern resembling that of the incoherent anaphors. These results suggest that semantic incoherence can preclude readers from engaging in anaphoric inferencing.

Energy, because of its global system nature, presents challenges beyond those of conventional resource management. To meet these challenges we propose the Currentcy Model that unifies energy accounting over diverse hardware components and enables fair allocation of available energy among applications. Our particular goal is to extend battery lifetime by limiting the average discharge rate and to share this limited resource among competing task according to user preferences. To demonstrate how our framework supports explicit control over the battery resource we implemented ECOSystem, a modified Linux, that incorporates our currentcy model. Experimental results show that ECOSystem accurately accounts for the energy consumed by asynchronous device operation, can achieve a target battery lifetime, and proportionally shares the limited energy resource among competing tasks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the comprehension of appositive relative clauses and nominal appositives. First, we present experimental evidence that suggests that nominal appositives and appositive relative clauses behave like other adjunct phrases with respect to ambiguity resolution (Experiment 1). Second, we show that an ambiguous nominal appositive can modify a distant syntactic head as easily across an appositive relative clause as across a restrictive relative clause (Experiment 2). Last, we show that syntactic repair is as successful across an appositive relative clause or parenthetical as it is across an at-issue restrictive relative clause (Experiment 3). Taken together, our results suggest that i) appositive relative clauses and nominal appositives are syntactically sited in a fashion comparable to restrictive relative clauses and ii) appositive phrases do not substantially reduce the availability of the syntactic material that precedes the appositive phrase as might have been expected if processing an appositive involved shifting attention to a higher structure, away from local preceding constituents. These results constitute an argument from sentence comprehension for a local syntactic attachment of appositive relative clauses and nominal appositives (cf. Jackendoff 1977; Potts 2005; de Vries 2006), and against so-called orphan analyses of appositive content (e.g. Ross 1967; Haegeman 1988).},

abstract = {The ability to trade accuracy for speed is fundamental to human decision making. The speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) effect has received decades of study, and is well understood in relatively simple decisions: collecting more evidence before making a decision allows one to be more accurate but also slower. The SAT in more complex paradigms has been given less attention, largely due to limits in the models and statistics that can be applied to such tasks. Here, we have conducted the first analysis of the SAT in multiple signal processing, using recently developed technologies for measuring capacity that take into account both response time and choice probability. We show that the primary influence of caution in our redundant-target experiments is on the threshold amount of evidence required to trigger a response. However, in a departure from the usual SAT effect, we found that participants strategically ignored redundant information when they were forced to respond quickly, but only when the additional stimulus was reliably redundant. Interestingly, because the capacity of the system was severely limited on redundant-target trials, ignoring additional targets meant that processing was more efficient when making fast decisions than when making slow and accurate decisions, where participants' limited resources had to be divided between the 2 stimuli.},

abstract = {Is forgetting in the short term due to decay with the mere passage of time, interference from other memoranda, or both? Past research on short-term memory has revealed some evidence for decay and a plethora of evidence showing that short-term memory is worsened by interference. However, none of these studies has directly contrasted decay and interference in short-term memory in a task that rules out the use of rehearsal processes. In this article the authors present a series of studies using a novel paradigm to address this problem directly, by interrogating the operation of decay and interference in short-term memory without rehearsal confounds. The results of these studies indicate that short-term memories are subject to very small decay effects with the mere passage of time but that interference plays a much larger role in their degradation. The authors discuss the implications of these results for existing models of memory decay and interference. Why do we forget when the information to be remembered is modest in amount and the retention interval is short? That is, what causes forgetting of information in short-term memory? This is a question that has engaged psychology for over a century, and yet its answer remains elusive. One theory that has a long history in accounting for forgetting is decay. The claim of this theory is that as time passes, information in memory erodes and is therefore less available for later retrieval. Decay has been a popular concept with respect to short-term memory, especially with the emergence and influence of Badde-ley's short-term memory architecture (Baddeley, 2000; Baddeley {\&} Hitch, 1974). However, the concept of decay is not without problems. For one, the concept does not make much sense without elaboration. After all, the mere passage of time alone cannot cause forgetting. For a decay theory to be of value, it must lay claim to some process or processes that occur more and more as time passes. Finding the mechanism or process of decay is one problem, but finding empirical evidence for decay is an even greater problem. In principle, it seems relatively straightforward to conduct an exper-iment to examine whether decay is a cause of forgetting: Provide a participant with some material to memorize, allow a varying short period of time during which the material must be maintained in memory, and then probe the participant to determine how much information was retained. If decay is operating, then as the length of the retention interval increases, there should be worse retrieval of the retained information. Although this experiment is in prin-ciple straightforward, in practice it is difficult to execute convinc-ingly in a way that rules out alternative accounts. Consider the classic study of Peterson and Peterson (1959), originally thought to provide strong evidence for decay. In this experiment, participants were given a letter trigram to store, fol-lowed by a retention interval that varied from 3 to 18 s. During the retention interval, participants were required to count backward by threes to prevent rehearsal of the memorandum. Following the retention interval, participants recalled the item in memory. Peter-son and Peterson found that performance declined as retention intervals increased, and the authors attributed this decline to in-creasing decay of the memory trace with increasing time. The attribution of this effect to a decay mechanism is, however, sus-pect. First, Peterson and Peterson argued that counting backward could not be a source of interference because their secondary-task materials differed sufficiently from the item to be stored in mem-ory (letters vs. numbers). Yet, it is surely the case that the counting task requires short-term retention of material, just as does the main memory task (e.g., you have to remember the number 743 to do a subtraction of 3 from it to yield the next number in the series). So, retroactive interference is a likely contributor in this task. Also, others have shown that interference can be produced by other verbalizable items that are not similar to the to-be-remembered material (Postle, D'Esposito, {\&} Corkin, 2005; Wixted, 2005), blunting Peterson and Peterson's interference argument. There-fore, Peterson and Peterson's claim that the materials are suffi-ciently distinct to avoid interference may not be appropriate. Second, Keppel and Underwood (1962) showed that on the very first trial of an experiment like that of Peterson and Peterson (1959), there is little or no forgetting as a function of retention interval even though there is such forgetting on later trials. Keppel and Underwood interpreted this contrast between first and later},

We conclude that the relative proportions of morphosyntactic variants in a corpus are the most significant predictor of a variant's acceptability to native speakers, and that in particular high relative proportions of one variant in a corpus are reliable indicators of high acceptability to native speakers. At the same time we note the limits of this predictability: low-frequency items, as noted elsewhere in the literature, often enjoy high levels of acceptability. Statistical preemption thus appears as a more limited phenomenon than had heretofore been posited.},

abstract = {Determining how language comprehension proceeds over time has been central to theories of human language use. Early research on the comprehension of speech in real time put special emphasis on the sequential property of speech, by assuming that the interpretation of what is said proceeds at the same rate that information in the speech signal reaches the senses. The picture that is emerging from recent work suggests a more complex process, one in which information from speech has an immediate influence while enabling later-arriving information to modulate initial hypotheses. ‘‘Right-context'' effects, in which the later portion of a spoken stimulus can affect the interpretation of an earlier portion, are pervasive and can span several syllables or words. Thus, the interpretation of a segment of speech appears to result fromthe accumulation of information and integration of linguistic constraints over a larger temporal window than the duration of the speech segment itself. This helps explain how human listeners can understand language so efficiently, despite massive perceptual uncertainty in the speech signal.},

abstract = {We examined the effects of argument-head distance in SVO and SOV languages (Spanish and German), while taking into account readers' working memory capacity and controlling for expectation (Levy, 2008) and other factors. We predicted only locality effects, that is, a slowdown produced by increased dependency distance (Gibson, 2000; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005). Furthermore, we expected stronger locality effects for readers with low working memory capacity. Contrary to our predictions, low-capacity readers showed faster reading with increased distance, while high-capacity readers showed locality effects. We suggest that while the locality effects are compatible with memory-based explanations, the speedup of low-capacity readers can be explained by an increased probability of retrieval failure. We present a computational model based on ACT-R built under the previous assumptions, which is able to give a qualitative account for the present data and can be tested in future research. Our results suggest that in some cases, interpreting longer RTs as indexing increased processing difficulty and shorter RTs as facilitation may be too simplistic: The same increase in processing difficulty may lead to slowdowns in high-capacity readers and speedups in low-capacity ones. Ignoring individual level capacity differences when investigating locality effects may lead to misleading conclusions},

Vowels were produced in /rabVp/ and /rabVt/ nonsense disyllables in carrier phrases by 3 speakers and presented in a categorial AXB discrimination task. Two groups were tested: AE listeners who had studied French extensively beginning after age 13 (Exp) and non-French-speaking AE listeners (Inexp). The Exp group performed better than the Inexp group on /u-{\oe}/, /i-y/ and /y-{\oe}/ (mean errors: Exp=5{\%}, Inexp=24{\%}). However, for /u-y/, the groups did not differ (Exp=30{\%} vs Inexp=24{\%} errors). The Inexp group confused /i-y/ more often in bilabial context, but /u-y/ more often in alveolar context, whereas the Exp group confused /u-y/ in both contexts. Overall, the Inexp group performed better in bilabial than in alveolar context (16{\%} vs 32{\%} errors), whereas the Exp group revealed no context effect.

abstract = {This paper deals with the impact of the salience of complex words and their constituent parts on lexical access. While almost 40 years of psycholinguistic studies have focused on the relevance of morphological structure for word recognition, little attention has been devoted to the relationship between the word as a whole unit and its constituent morphemes. Depending on the theoretical approach adopted, complex words have been seen either in the light of their paradigmatic environment (i.e., from a paradigmatic view), or in terms of their internal structure (i.e., from a syntagmatic view). These two competing views have strongly determined the choice of experimental factors manipulated in studies on morphological processing (mainly different lexical frequencies, word/non-word structure, and morphological family size). Moreover, work on various kinds of more or less segmentable items (from genuinely morphologically complex words like hunter to words exhibiting only a surface morphological structure like corner and irregular forms like thieves) has given rise to two competing hypotheses on the cognitive role of morphology. The first hypothesis claims that morphology organizes whole words into morphological families and series, while the second sets morphology at a pre-lexical level, with morphemes standing as access units to the mental lexicon. The present paper examines more deeply the notion of morphological salience and its implications for theories and models of morphological processing. In linguistics, the semiotic notion of salience has been applied to inflectional and derivational morphology from the 1980s onward, mainly in the framework of 'Natural Morphology' (NM; e.g., Dressler et al., 1987). In this approach, the idea of morphological salience refers to the relative importance or prominence of a morpheme (stem or affix) in a morphologically complex word, the underlying assumption being that the salience of morphological components drives the mechanisms underlying complex word processing as well as storage and lexical organization. More recently, in the domain of language acquisition, Goldschneider and DeKeyser (2001) defined morphological salience as referring to " how easy it is to hear or perceive a given structure " (p. 22). In the Natural Morphology (henceforth: NM) approach, salience is one of the factors that contribute to the 'naturalness' of a linguistic item or structure, which in turn determines how easily it can be processed by the human brain (Dressler et al., 1987, p. 11). Thus, NM theory explicitly defines naturalness on psychological grounds and makes particular reference to cognitive limitations on perception and processing (e.g., on memory, information recall, and selective Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 November 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1778},

The present work provides a comprehensive overview of SAT. First, I trace its history as a tractable behavioral phenomenon and the role it has played in shaping mathematical descriptions of the decision process. Second, I present a "users guide" of SAT methodology, including a critical review of common experimental manipulations and analysis techniques and a treatment of the typical behavioral patterns that emerge when SAT is manipulated directly. Finally, I review applications of this methodology in several domains.},

abstract = {A Bayesian system identification technique was used to determine which image characteristics predict where people fixate when viewing natural images. More specifically an estimate was derived for the mapping between image characteristics at a given location and the probability that this location was fixated. Using a large database of eye fixations to natural images, we determined the most probable (a posteriori) model of this mapping. From a set of candidate feature maps consisting of edge, contrast and luminance maps (at two different spatial scales), fixation probability was dominated by high spatial frequency edge information. The best model applied compressive non-linearity to the high frequency edge detecting filters (approximately a square root). Both low spatial frequency edges and contrast had weaker, but inhibitory, effects. The contributions of the other maps were so small as to be behaviourally irrelevant. This Bayesian method identifies not only the relevant weighting of the different maps, but how this weighting varies as a function of distance from the point of fixation. It was found that rather than centre surround inhibition, the weightings simply averaged over an area of about 2 degrees.},

abstract = {The Bayes Factor is an averaged likelihood ratio for evaluating models using data. It automatically balances goodness-of-fit with complexity, and is among the most important and widely-used measures in Bayesian statistics. We argue that Bayes Factors are useful measures for the quantitative evaluation of statistical hypotheses and specific models in psychology, but have been under-used because they are often difficult to compute. We develop a largely automated method for estimating Bayes Factors based on the pioneering work of Carlin and Chib (1995), and provide all of the code needed for practical implementation. The method uses a conceptually simple approach, and is applicable to a very general range of situations, including the comparison of non-nested and hierarchical hypotheses and models. We demonstrate our method in two illustrative examples, and validate its accuracy where possible using an alternative method for estimating Bayes Factors. We conclude with a discussion of the strengths and limitations of our method, and argue it offers a relatively easy-to-use and general capability for the quantitative evaluation of hypotheses and models in psychology.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Taylor {\&} Francis Previous studies have shown that comprehenders use rich contextual information to anticipate upcoming input on the fly, but less is known about how comprehenders integrate different sources of information to generate predictions in real time. The current study examines the time course with which the lexical meaning and structural roles of preverbal arguments impact comprehenders' lexical semantic predictions about an upcoming verb in two event-related potential (ERP) experiments that use the N400 amplitude as a measure of online predictability. Experiment 1 showed that the N400 was sensitive to predictability when the verb's cloze probability was reduced by substituting one of the arguments (e.g. “The superintendent overheard which tenant/realtor the landlord had evicted {\ldots} ”), but not when the verb's cloze probability was reduced by simply swapping the roles of the arguments (e.g. “The restaurant owner forgot which customer/waitress the waitress/customer had served {\ldots} ”). Experiment 2 showed that argument substitution elicited an N400 effect even when the substituted argument appeared elsewhere in the sentence, indicating that verb predictions are specifically driven by the arguments in the same clause as the verb, rather than by a simple “bag-of-words” mechanism. We propose that verb predictions initially rely on a “bag-of-arguments” mechanism, which specifically relies on the lexical meaning, but not the structural roles, of the arguments in a clause.},

that simple and complex span tasks largely measure the same basic
subcomponent processes (e.g., rehearsal, maintenance, updating, controlled
search) but differ in the extent to which these processes operate
in a particular task. These differences largely depend on the extent
to which phonological processes are maximized and variability from
long list lengths is present. Potential methodological, psychometric,
and assessment implications are discussed and a theoretical account
of the data is proposed.},

abstract = {Two experiments investigated the acceptability of multiple questions. As expected, sentences violating the Superiority Condition were accepted less often than sentences obeying it. The status of the Superiority violations was not improved by the addition of a third wh, regardless of whether the third wh was an adjunct or an argument, though it was improved by the addition of a second question (e.g., and when). Further, in a small pilot study directly comparing a sentence with adjacent final wh-phrases that may induce a stress clash (I'd like to know who hid it where when) with a sentence violating Superiority but avoiding the final adjacent wh-phrases (I'd like to know where who hid it when), half the participants indicated that the Superiority violation sentence sounded better. This suggests that the status of some additional-wh sentences may appear to improve simply because the comparison sentence with adjacent final wh-phrases is degraded. Overall, the results of the studies suggest that there is no need to complicate syntactic theory to account for the additional-wh effect, because there is no general additional-wh effect.},

@article{FranckColonnaRizzi:2015,
abstract = {We report three experiments on French that explore number mismatch effects in intervention configurations in the comprehension of object A'-dependencies, relative clauses and questions. The study capitalizes on the finding of object attraction in sentence production, in which speakers sometimes erroneously produce a verb that agrees in number with a plural object in object relative clauses. Evidence points to the role of three critical constructs from formal syntax: intervention, intermediate traces and c-command (Franck et al., 2010). Experiment 1, using a self-paced reading procedure on these grammatical structures with an agreement error on the verb, shows an enhancing effect of number mismatch in intervention configurations, with faster reading times with plural (mismatching) objects. Experiment 2, using an on-line grammaticality judgment task on the ungrammatical versions of these structures, shows an interference effect in the form of attraction, with slower response times with plural objects. Experiment 3 with a similar grammaticality judgment task shows stronger attraction from c-commanding than from preceding interveners. Overall, the data suggest that syntactic computations in performance refer to the same syntactic representations in production and comprehension, but that different tasks tap into different processes involved in parsing: whereas performance in self-paced reading reflects the intervention of the subject in the process of building an object A'-dependency, performance in grammaticality judgment reflects intervention of the object on the computation of the subject-verb agreement dependency. The latter shows the hallmarks of structure-dependent attraction effects in sentence production, in particular, a sensitivity to specific characteristics of hierarchical representations.},

abstract = {Competence-based theories of island effects play a central role in generative grammar, yet the graded nature of many syntactic islands has never been properly accounted for. Categorical syn- tactic accounts of island effects have persisted in spite of a wealth of data suggesting that island ef- fects are not categorical in nature and that nonstructural manipulations that leave island structures intact can radically alter judgments of island violations. We argue here, building on work by Paul Deane, Robert Kluender, and others, that processing factors have the potential to account for this otherwise unexplained variation in acceptability judgments. We report the results of self-paced reading experiments and controlled acceptability studies that explore the relationship between processing costs and judgments of acceptability. In each of the three self-paced reading studies, the data indicate that the processing cost of different types of is- land violations can be significantly reduced to a degree comparable to that of nonisland filler-gap constructions by manipulating a single nonstructural factor. Moreover, this reduction in process- ing cost is accompanied by significant improvements in acceptability. This evidence favors the hy- pothesis that island-violating constructions involve numerous processing pressures that aggregate to drive processing difficulty above a threshold, resulting in unacceptability. We examine the im- plications of these findings for the grammar of filler-gap dependencies.},

abstract = {Past studies have shown that antecedent prominence affects the processing of a pronoun, but these studies have used experimental methodologies that do not make it possible to determine at what stage(s) of pronominal resolution these effects occur. We used the speed-accuracy tradeoff procedure to investigate whether antecedent prominence affects the accuracy of antecedent retrieval, the speed of resolution, or both. Consistent with previous results, we find that accuracy is higher when antecedents are prominent than when they are not (cf. Foraker {\&} McElree, 2007). However, in contrast to previous results, we also find that prominence impacts the speed with which the pronominal dependency is resolved. We consider the implications of our findings for various models of pronoun resolution and offer suggestions for how to implement prominence-sensitive speed differences within a cue-based retrieval architecture.

abstract = {Two classes of account have been proposed to explain the memory processes subserving the processing of reflexive-antecedent dependencies. Structure-based accounts assume that the retrieval of the antecedent is guided by syntactic tree-configurational information without considering other kinds of information such as gender marking in the case of English reflexives. By contrast, unconstrained cue-based retrieval assumes that all available information is used for retrieving the antecedent. Similarity-based interference effects from structurally illicit distractors which match a non-structural retrieval cue have been interpreted as evidence favoring the unconstrained cue-based retrieval account since cue-based retrieval interference from structurally illicit distractors is incompatible with the structure-based account. However, it has been argued that the observed effects do not necessarily reflect interference occurring at the moment of retrieval but might equally well be accounted for by interference occurring already at the stage of encoding or maintaining the antecedent in memory, in which case they cannot be taken as evidence against the structure-based account. We present three experiments (self-paced reading and eye-tracking) on German reflexives and Swedish reflexive and pronominal possessives in which we pit the predictions of encoding interference and cue-based retrieval interference against each other. We could not find any indication that encoding interference affects the processing ease of the reflexive-antecedent dependency formation. Thus, there is no evidence that encoding interference might be the explanation for the interference effects observed in previous work. We therefore conclude that invoking encoding interference may not be a plausible way to reconcile interference effects with a structure-based account of reflexive processing.},

Hence, theories focusing on processing as an explanation for what the reading span task really measures are incomplete. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
annote = {- two goals: influence administration method and relationship between processing and storage
- time for strategy-use in participant-administered version decreased correlations with reading comprehension and verbal SAT
- processing did not mediate relationship with comprehension, hence theories that focus on processing as an explanation are incomplete


- still unclear, what wmc tasks really measure
- engle, cantor and carullo (1992): partialling-out of strategy times increases correlation with operation span
- turley-ames {\{}{\&}{\}} whitfield (2003): training for application of a certain strategy increases operation span scores and their correlation with reading ability; their interpretation: individual differences in strategy-use suppress relationship between wmc and reading ability
- waters {\{}{\&}{\}} caplan (1996) allow self-pacing and observe greatly varying reading times at span size (2.2 to 11.5s)
- solution: minimize strategy-use as much as possible
- processing overlap theory: "{\{}{\ldots}{\}}the major reason for the correlation between reading span and comprehension is that the processing component of the reading span task mimics the requirements of the comprehension task(s)." (138
- resource sharing theory: processing and storage rely on shared resources
- time-based forgetting theory


1) what is the correlation between processing and storage?
- uninteresting: positive correlation between processing and recall (speed-accuracy tradeoff)
- more interesting: null (proc and storage independent) or negative correlation (recall somehow dependent on processing)


2) does sentence position affect processing time?
- resource-sharing: processing times should incrementally increase with sentence position (other two: no influence of sentence position on processing time)


3) do proc times mediate correlation between rst and comp?
- core question: why do complex memory measures better predict comprehension than simple storage measures?
- multiple regression and semi-partial correlation analyses
- mediation consistent with time-based forg. and overlap


4) do processing times improve the predictive value of the wmc scores?
- waters {\{}{\&}{\}} caplan (1996): processing and storage independent, processing major predictor
- "{\{}{\ldots}{\}}rather than partialling out processing times from span scores, it may be better to add them to the span scores." (139


experiment
- two parallel rst
- two times increasing set sizes with 3 sets per size (to compute cronbachs alpha and split-half rel.)
- experimenter-paced: experimenter presses button as soon as particpiant has finished reading the sentence (not really experimenter-paced, is it?)
- serial order if possible, otherwise not the last word first
- baseline reading speed
- word span
- comprehension tests from practice sat test
- strategy interviews
- two sessions per subject, each test twice
- fixed order
- rst: total number words recalled


results
- groups did not significiantly differ from each other
- corr should be equally high in both groups and higher than with word span
- but: higher in in exp-paced group
- sig interaction reading span x administration for reading comprehension and verbal sat
- when partialling out word span, reading span remained a significant predictor for comprehension only in the exp-adm condition
- different correlations with comp. and vsat cannot be explained in terms of internal reliablity
- nor in terms of outliers
- part-adm. more likely to use phonological rehearsal as strategy, but differences not substantial
- anova on reading span scores (wmc{\~{}}group): part.-adm scores sig. higher and reads sig. more slowly
- exp-adm: longer reading times and lower scores
- part.-adm: longer reading times and higher scores
- partialling out reading time lowered correlation in exp-adm group but raised it in part-adm; partialling out deleted differences in correlation magnitude between groups
- regression slopes no longer sig. different
- results strongly support hypothesis that lower correlations in part-adm are due to time to implement strategies


what is correlation between recall and processing times?
- negative correlation in exp-adm group (consistent with time-based forgetting and resource-sharing)
- positive correlation in part-adm group (like engle et al. 1992)


does sentence position affect processing time?
- sig. sentence position effect
- systematically related to recall scores (consistent with resource sharing hypothesis, inconsistent with the others)
- no sig correlation of recall with sentence position in part-adm (but of reading times with sentence position)


do reading times mediate correlation with comprehension?
- core question: do processing measures predict comprehension over and above reading span scores?
- in exp-adm group reading span still sig predictor, when all other predictors (reading times and sentence position slopes) contributed significantly
- both processing measures predicted comprehensino over and above wmc, word span and the interaction of the two in exp-adm
- other pattern in part-adm: reading span scores explained more variance when reading span times were included
- semipartial correlations: removed variance from word span and word span x reading span {\textgreater} correlation between reading span and comprehension not attributable to variance associated with word span
- exp-adm: semipartial correlation still significant
- part-adm: no sig correlation when word span partialled out


summary:
- processing measures do not account for much shared variance (inconsistent with time-based forgetting and processing overlap: both predict processing efficiency as key mediating variable)
- also inconsistent with resource-sharing theory
- results contradict all three theories
- z scores like waters {\{}{\&}{\}} caplan (1996) correlated between .82 and .83 in exp-adm and from .53 to .72 in part-adm {\textgreater} replication
- also waters-caplan: z score better with ndrt than recall alone
- here only small differences in exp-adm, but the same results in part-adm


general disc
- studies that did not find correlation between reading times and recall did probably allow strategy-use
- no improvement in exp-adm with z scores (waters-caplan)
- processing and storage not unrelated (contradicts overlap theory)
- linear position effect (contradicts overlap and forgetting, in line with sharing)
- missing mediation of correlation by processing times rules out all three theories
- adding processing times only improves correlation in the part-adm group, thus only a correction for strategy-application
- none of the theories is satisfactory, maybe inhibition or controlled attention can better explain what the task really measures


recommendations:
1) do not allow participant-paced reading
2) obtain rt measure
3) include measure of criterion validity},

Despite this, major models of eye movement control in reading do not explicitly model word identification from visual input. This paper presents an argument for developing models of eye movements that do include detailed models of word identification. Specifically, we argue that insights into eye movement behaviour can be gained by understanding which phenomena naturally arise from an account in which the eyes move for efficient word identification, and that one important use of such models is to test which eye movement phenomena can be understood this way. As an extended case study, we present evidence from an extension of a previous model of eye movement control in reading that does explicitly model word identification from visual input, Mr. Chips (Legge, Klitz, {\&} Tjan, 1997), to test two proposals for the effect of using linguistic context on reading efficiency.

The aim of these manipulations is to see whether the parser is sensitive to the type of dependencies being processed and whether the processing effects can be explained by a unique processing principle, the minimal chain principle (MCP; De Vincenzi, 1991). The results show that the parser, following the MCP, prefers structures with fewer and less complex chains. In particular: (1) There is a processing advantage for the wh-subject extractions, the structures with less complex chains; (2) there is a processing dissociation between the who and which questions; (3) the parser respects the principle that governs the well-formedness of the empty categories (ECP).},

abstract = {We consider several key aspects of prediction in language comprehension: its computational nature, the representational level(s) at which we predict, whether we use higher level representations to predictively pre-activate lower level representations, and whether we ‘commit' in any way to our predictions, beyond pre-activation. We argue that the bulk of behavioral and neural evidence suggests that we predict probabilistically and at multiple levels and grains of representation. We also argue that we can, in principle, use higher level inferences to predictively pre-activate information at multiple lower representational levels. We also suggest that the degree and level of predictive pre-activation might be a function of the expected utility of prediction, which, in turn, may depend on comprehenders' goals and their estimates of the relative reliability of their prior knowledge and the bottom-up input.

abstract = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the
macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas
has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary
of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other
modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing
large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the
application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization
of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system,
which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively
visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as
visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs.
A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association
areas have been reported. This represents 31{\%} of the possible number
of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual
degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40{\%}. The great majority
of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are
also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual
system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical,
transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal
lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified
pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity
of about 40{\%}. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between
areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor
areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent
studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10
levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels
if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the
bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top.
Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing
streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental
organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related
to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and
parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships
(about 10{\%} of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into
this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances,
though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions
to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities
in the reported assignment.},

abstract = {Many studies have suggested that a word鈥檚 orthographic form must be processed before its meaning becomes available. Some interpret the (null) finding of equal facilitation after semantically transparent and opaque morphologically related primes in early stages of morphological processing as consistent with this view. Recent literature suggests that morphological facilitation tends to be greater after transparent than after opaque primes, however. To determine whether the degree of semantic transparency influences parsing into a stem and a suffix (morphological decomposition) in the forward masked priming variant of the lexical decision paradigm, we compared patterns of facilitation between semantically transparent (e.g., coolant鈥揷ool) and opaque (e.g., rampant鈥搑amp) prime鈥?target pairs. Form properties of the stem (frequency, neighborhood size, and prime鈥搕arget letter overlap), as well as related鈥搖nrelated and transparent鈥搊paque affixes, were matched. Morphological facilitation was significantly greater for semantically transparent pairs than for opaque pairs. Ratings of prime鈥搕arget relatedness predicted the magnitude of facilitation. The results limit the scope of form-then-meaning models of word recognition and demonstrate that semantic similarity can influence even early stages of morphological processing.

abstract = {Daytime measures of sleep latency and subjective alertness do not correlate with one another, suggesting that they assess different aspects of alertness. In addition, their typical diurnal variations show very different time courses. Quantitative analysis of the waking electroencephalogram (EEG) has been proposed as an objective measure of alertness, but it is not clear how it compares with other measures. In this study, the waking EEG was measured in the daytime to determine the presence of diurnal variations in the activity of standard frequency bands and to compare these variations with the temporal patterns typical of sleep propensity and subjective alertness. Alertness was evaluated in four men and 12 women, aged 19-33 y. Assessments were conducted every 2 h, from 10.00 to 24.00, in the following order: a visual analogue scale of alertness, a waking EEG recording and a sleep latency test. The waking EEG was recorded with eyes open. For each recording session, 32-60 s of artefact-free signals were selected from the C3/A2 derivation, then subjected to amplitude spectral analysis. Four EEG frequency bands showed significant diurnal variations: delta, theta, sigma and beta1. None of these variations showed a significant correlation with the temporal patterns of sleep latencies or subjective alertness. At the individual level, however, theta band activity increased when subjective alertness decreased, suggesting that the theta band can be used to monitor variations in alertness in a given individual, even at the moderate levels of sleepiness experienced during the daytime.},

abstract = {Delaying the appearance of a verb in a noun-verb dependency tends to increase processing difficulty at the verb; one explanation for this locality effect is decay and/or interference of the noun in working memory. Surprisal, an expectation-based account, predicts that delaying the appearance of a verb either renders it no more predictable or more predictable, leading respectively to a prediction of no effect of distance or a facilitation. Recently, Husain et al (2014) suggested that when the exact identity of the upcoming verb is predictable (strong predictability), increasing argument-verb distance leads to facilitation effects, which is consistent with surprisal; but when the exact identity of the upcoming verb is not predictable (weak predictability), locality effects are seen. We investigated Husain et al.'s proposal using Persian complex predicates (CPs), which consist of a non-verbal element---a noun in the current study---and a verb. In CPs, once the noun has been read, the exact identity of the verb is highly predictable (strong predictability); this was confirmed using a sentence completion study. In two self-paced reading (SPR) and two eye-tracking (ET) experiments, we delayed the appearance of the verb by interposing a relative clause (Expt. 1 and 3) or a long PP (Expt. 2 and 4). We also included a simple Noun-Verb predicate configuration with the same distance manipulation; here, the exact identity of the verb was not predictable (weak predictability). Thus, the design crossed Predictability Strength and Distance. We found that, consistent with surprisal, the verb in the strong predictability conditions was read faster than in the weak predictability conditions. Furthermore, greater verb-argument distance led to slower reading times; strong predictability did not neutralize or attenuate the locality effects. As regards the effect of distance on dependency resolution difficulty, these four experiments present evidence in favor of working memory accounts of argument-verb dependency resolution, and against the surprisal-based expectation account of Levy (2008). However, another expectation-based measure, entropy, which was computed using the offline sentence completion data, predicts reading times in Experiment 1. We suggest that forgetting due to memory overload leads to greater entropy at the verb.},

abstract = {Two questionnaire studies and two experiments investigated the processing of the pronouns her and him/his. The questionnaires and the first experiment searched for effects of lexical preferences in resolving the temporary syntactic category ambiguity of the word her. Contingent frequency based on a verb's preference for a human vs an inanimate direct object demonstrably affected the final interpretation of an ambiguous her following the verb in an off-line questionnaire study. However, it did not influence on-line processing times for SPEC versus NP uses of her. This result is surprising from the perspective of current lexically based models of ambiguity resolution. Experiment 2 addressed how potential antecedents for the unambiguous pronouns him and his are identified. Both Experiment I and Experiment 2 showed that NP uses of personal pronouns like her and him could be processed more easily than SPEC uses of her and his. Experiment 2 showed that this difference largely reflected differences in difficulty of choosing an antecedent for the pronoun. To account for the processing of her, we proposed that the parser initially builds an underspecified syntactic representation, fixing further details and disambiguating the category of her as subsequent information becomes available. Comprehension proceeds by attempting to find an antecedent for the personal pronoun, with the preferred candidate a syntactically available within-sentence antecedent if one exists.

abstract = {In 1980, the N400 event-related potential was described in association with semantic anomalies within sentences. When, in 1992, a second waveform, the P600, was reported in association with syntactic anomalies and ambiguities, the story appeared to be complete: the brain respected a distinction between semantic and syntactic representation and processes. Subsequent studies showed that the P600 to syntactic anomalies and ambiguities was modulated by lexical and discourse factors. Most surprisingly, more than a decade after the P600 was first described, a series of studies reported that semantic verb-argument violations, in the absence of any violations or ambiguities of syntax can evoke robust P600 effects and no N400 effects. These observations have raised fundamental questions about the relationship between semantic and syntactic processing in the brain. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent studies that have demonstrated P600s to semantic violations in light of several proposed triggers: semantic-thematic attraction, semantic associative relationships, animacy and semantic-thematic violations, plausibility, task, and context. I then discuss these findings in relation to a unifying theory that attempts to bring some of these factors together and to link the P600 produced by semantic verb-argument violations with the P600 evoked by unambiguous syntactic violations and syntactic ambiguities. I suggest that normal language comprehension proceeds along at least two competing neural processing streams: a semantic memory-based mechanism, and a combinatorial mechanism (or mechanisms) that assigns structure to a sentence primarily on the basis of morphosyntactic rules, but also on the basis of certain semantic-thematic constraints. I suggest that conflicts between the different representations that are output by these distinct but interactive streams lead to a continued combinatorial analysis that is reflected by the P600 effect. I discuss some of the implications of this non-syntactocentric, dynamic model of language processing for understanding individual differences, language processing disorders and the neuroanatomical circuitry engaged during language comprehension. Finally, I suggest that that these two processing streams may generalize beyond the language system to real-world visual event comprehension.},

In this article, we assess several fitting techniques by simulating six widely cited models of response time and using the fitting procedures to recover model parameters. The techniques include the maximization of likelihood and least squares fits of the theoretical distributions to different empirical estimates of the simulated distributions. A running example is used to illustrate the different estimation and fitting procedures. The simulation studies reveal that empirical density estimates are biased even for very large sample sizes. Some fitting techniques yield more accurate and less variable parameter estimates than do others. Methods that involve least squares fits to density estimates generally yield very poor parameter estimates.},

abstract = {Invariant features of temporally varying signals are useful for analysis
and classification. Slow feature analysis (SFA) is a new method for
learning invariant or slowly varying features from a vectorial input
signal. It is based on a nonlinear expansion of the input signal
and application of principal component analysis to this expanded
signal and its time derivative. It is guaranteed to find the optimal
solution within a family of functions directly and can learn to extract
a large number of decorrelated features, which are ordered by their
degree of invariance. SFA can be applied hierarchically to process
high-dimensional input signals and extract complex features. SFA
is applied first to complex cell tuning properties based on simple
cell output, including disparity and motion. Then more complicated
input-output functions are learned by repeated application of SFA.
Finally, a hierarchical network of SFA modules is presented as a
simple model of the visual system. The same unstructured network
can learn translation, size, rotation, contrast, or, to a lesser
degree, illumination invariance for one-dimensional objects, depending
on only the training stimulus. Surprisingly, only a few training
objects suffice to achieve good generalization to new objects. The
generated representation is suitable for object recognition. Performance
degrades if the network is trained to learn multiple invariances
simultaneously.},

Examining RNN behavior on experimentally controlled sentences designed to expose filler-gap dependencies, we show that RNNs can represent the relationship in multiple syntactic positions and over large spans of text. Furthermore, we show that RNNs learn a subset of the known restrictions on filler-gap dependencies, known as island constraints: RNNs show evidence for wh-islands, adjunct islands, and complex NP islands.

It is capable of accounting for stimulus-response compatibility, which is known to be an influential task variable determining choice-reaction performance but has not been considered in previous mathematical modeling efforts. Specific MDV models were developed for 5 experiments using the Simon task, for which stimulus location is task irrelevant, to examine the validity of model assumptions and illustrate characteristic behaviors of model parameters. The MDV models accounted for the experimental data to a remarkable degree, demonstrating the adequacy of the framework as a general schema for modeling the latency of choice performance.

Covert shifts of attention precede involuntary eye movements


- Peterson, M S; Kramer, A F; Irwin, D E )



BACKGROUND
Involuntary saccades: Reaction to a sudden luminance change
According to Mokler and Fischer (1999), involuntary saccades are not preceded by covert attention shifts, because subjects are not aware of involuntary eye movements.




AIM
Find out if covert attention and overt attention are coupled when faced with endogenous and exogenous cues simultaneously.




BASIC DESIGN
- Six grey circles flip color, except for one. In addition, an additional distractor circle (called "onset"!?) appears, that Ss have to move their eyes to.
- Before any eye movement takes place the "onset" circle contains a probe letter, which is congruent or incongruent with the response target in the grey circle. The probe is big enough to be recognized without an eye movement. 
- The grey circle sometimes contains the response target right away, sometimes only once the eyes have landed (technically, once the eye have moved). At the beginning of the first eye movement, the probe disappears.




EXPERIMENT 1:
Setup like described in the basic design. Letters shown before first saccade onset were only sometimes the ones shown after the saccade. Congruency effects (old target=new target?, and old distractor=new target?) are of interest here.
Results:
- initial saccade went to toarget more often than to the distractor
- saccade latencies (of initial saccade) were shorter if eyes went to distractor
(- many more secondary saccades from distractor to target than from target to distractor
- if they went from target to distractor, saccades were slower
)
(a) When initial saccade went straight to TARGET, the only congruency that had an effect was the congruency between old target and new target
(b) When initial saccade went to DISTRACTOR, both congruency effects appeared, old target=new target and old distractor=new target. (The former was facilitating, while the latter had an adverse effect.




Effects (a) and (b) support the idea that attention shift to target is necessary to move your eyes there, and moving eyes to target prevents attention from wandering to distractor, i.e. that attention and voluntary eye movements are *very*tightly coupled. For involuntary eye-movements, however, there seems to be no such close link, since information from the target is also picked up, before the eyes move to the distractor. OR, as the authors suggest, the two attentional systems have different time courses and (b) can be explained in a setting, when attention moves to the distractor first, and then to the target, before the eyes have even moved there. [pretty cool!] 
Thus attention movement pattern is supposed to be quite similar to eye movment patterns, which are more likeley to go from distractor to target than from target to distractor on the second saccade, with the former also being faster than the latter.




EXPERIMENT 2:
Same setup, with one catch. Old target and old distractor are either shown early (0 to 100ms after color flip), or late (100-?ms after color filp).




Results:
When presentation is EARLY:
(a.1) When the initial saccade goes to TARGET, there is only a target congruency effect.
(b.1) When the initial saccade goes to DISTRACTOR, there is only a distractor congruency effect.
When presentation is LATE:
Same effect as in Experiment 1.
The EARLY effect is different, because there is not enough time to shift attention to both. 




CONCLUSIONS:
Attention can precede eye movements.

abstract = {Phonological properties of the words in a sentence have been shown to affect processing fluency and comprehension. However, the exact role of phonology in sentence comprehension remains unclear. If constituents are stored in working memory during routine processing and accessed through their phonological code, phonological information may exert a pervasive influence on post-lexical comprehension processes such as retrieval for thematic integration. On the other hand, if access to constituents in memory during parsing is guided primarily by syntactic and semantic information, the parser should be isolated from phonologically based effects. In two self-paced reading experiments, we tested whether phonological overlap between distractors and a retrieval target caused retrieval interference during thematic integration. We found that phonological overlap creates difficulty during the initial encoding of the filler, but there was no evidence that phonological overlap caused later interference when the filler was retrieved for thematic integration. Despite effects at encoding, phonological interference did not have a detrimental effect on comprehension. These results suggest that phonological information is not used as a retrieval cue during routine dependency construction in incremental sentence processing. We conclude by considering the potential importance of phonology in parsing under conditions of extraordinary syntactic and/or semantic interference.},

abstract = {In research on the role of lexical predictability in language comprehension, predictability is generally defined as the probability that a word is provided as a sentence continuation in the cloze task (Taylor, 1953), in which subjects are asked to guess the next word of a sentence. The present experiments investigate the process by which subjects generate a cloze response, by measuring the latency to initiate a response in a version of the task in which subjects produce a spoken continuation to a visually presented sentence fragment. Higher probability responses were produced faster than lower probability responses. The latency to produce a response was also influenced by item constraint: A response at a given level of probability was issued faster when the context was more constraining, i.e., a single response was elicited with high probability. We show that these patterns are naturally produced by an activation-based race model in which potential responses independently race towards a response threshold. Implications for the interpretation of cloze probability as a measure of lexical predictability are discussed.},

Modern theories of retrieval in sentence comprehension do not indicate how this variation and the role of encoding processes should influence memory performance. Here, memory retrieval in language comprehension is shown to be influenced by a target's representational complexity in terms of syntactic and semantic features. Three self-paced reading experiments provide evidence that reading times at retrieval sites (but not earlier) decrease when more complex phrases occur as filler-phrases in filler-gap dependencies. The data also show that complexity-based effects are not dependent on string length, syntactic differences, or the amount of processing the stimuli elicit. Activation boosting and reduced similarity-based interference are implicated as likely sources of these complexity-based effects.},

abstract = {The distribution of landing positions and durations of first fixations in a region containing a noun preceded by either an article (e.g., the soldiers) or a high-frequency 3-letter word (e.g., all soldiers) were compared. Although there were fewer first fixations on the blank space between the high-frequency 3-letter word and the noun than on the surrounding letters (and the fixations on the blank space were shorter), this pattern did not occur when the noun was preceded by an article. R. Radach (1996) inferred from a similar experiment that did not manipulate the type of short word that 2 words could be processed as a perceptual unit during reading when the first word is a short word. As this different pattern of fixations is restricted to article-noun pairs, it indicates that word grouping does not occur purely on the basis of word length during reading; moreover, as the authors demonstrate, one can explain the observed patterns in both conditions more parsimoniously without adopting a word-grouping mechanism in eye movement control during reading.},

models of focal visual attention that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based
control of attentional deployment. First, the perceptual saliency
of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second,
a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus
conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and
plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return,
the process by which the currently attended location is prevented
from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment.
Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational
challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control
attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly
constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these
five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological
understanding of visual attention.},

abstract = {Theoretical linguists claim that the notorious reflexive ziji 'self' in Mandarin Chinese, if occurring more than once in a single sentence, can take distinct antecedents. This study tackles possibly the most interesting puzzle in the linguistic literature, investigating how two occurrences of ziji in a single sentence are interpreted and whether or not there are mixed readings, i.e., these zijis are interpretively bound by distinct antecedents. Using 15 Chinese sentences each having two zijis, we conducted two sentence reading experiments based on a modified self-paced reading paradigm. The general interpretation patterns observed showed that the majority of participants associated both zijis with the same local antecedent, which was consistent with Principle A of the Standard Binding Theory and previous experimental findings involving a single ziji. In addition, mixed readings also occurred, but did not pattern as claimed in the theoretical linguistic literature (i.e., one ziji is bound by a long-distance antecedent and the other by a local antecedent). Based on these results, we argue that: (i) mixed readings were due to manifold, interlocking and conflicting perspectives taken by the participants; and (ii) cases of multiple occurrences of ziji taking distinct antecedents are illicit in Chinese syntax, since the speaker, when expressing a sentence, can select only one P(erspective)-Center that referentially denotes the psychological perspective in which the sentence is situated.},

abstract = {In the present report, we describe a new dynamic field theory that captures the dynamics of visuo-spatial cognition. This theory grew out of the dynamic systems approach to motor control and development, and is grounded in neural principles. The initial application of dynamic field theory to issues in visuo-spatial cognition extended concepts of the motor approach to decision making in a sensori-motor context, and, more recently, to the dynamics of spatial cognition. Here we extend these concepts still further to address topics in visual cognition, including visual working memory for non-spatial object properties, the processes that underlie change detection, and the 'binding problem' in vision. In each case, we demonstrate that the general principles of the dynamic field approach can unify findings in the literature and generate novel predictions. We contend that the application of these concepts to visual cognition avoids the pitfalls of reductionist approaches in cognitive science, and points toward a formal integration of brains, bodies, and behavior.},

abstract = {Even advanced Spanish speakers of second language English tend to confuse the pronouns ‘he' and ‘she', often without even noticing their mistake (Lahoz, 1991). A study by Ant{\'{o}}n- M{\'{e}}ndez (2010) has indicated that a possible reason for this er- ror is the fact that Spanish is a pro-drop language. In order to test this hypothesis, we used an extension of Dual-path (Chang, 2002), a computational cognitive model of sentence produc- tion, to simulate two models of bilingual speech production of second language English. One model had Spanish (ES) as a native language, whereas the other learned a Spanish-like lan- guage that used the pronoun at all times (non-pro-drop Span- ish, NPD{\_}ES). When tested on L2 English sentences, the bilin- gual pro-drop Spanish model produced significantly more gen- der pronoun errors, confirming that pronoun dropping could indeed be responsible for the gender confusion in natural lan- guage use as well.},

abstract = {We performed an exhaustive meta-analysis of 71 peer-reviewed journal articles consisting of syntactic priming production studies, consisting of 152 unique experiments from the seminal Bock (1986) paper through 2013. Extracting the effect size for each experiment and condition, where the effect size is the log odds ratio of the frequency of the primed structure X to the frequency of the unprimed structure Y, we found a robust effect of syntactic priming with an average weighted odds ratio of 1.68 when there is no lexical boost and 3.28 when there is. That is, a construction X which occurs 50{\%} of the time in the absence of priming would occur 63{\%} if primed without lexical repetition and 77{\%} of the time if primed with lexical repetition. The syntactic priming effect is robust across several different construction types and languages, and we found strong effects of lexical boost on the size of the priming effect as well as interactions between lexical boost and temporal lag and between lexical boost and whether the priming occurred within or across languages. We also analyzed the distribution of p-values across experiments in order to estimate the average statistical power of experiments in our sample and to assess publication bias. Analyzing a subset of experiments in which the primary result of interest is whether a particular structure showed a priming effect, we did not find clear evidence of selective reporting of results and the studies appear moderately well-powered after correcting for publication bias: 77{\%} power. However, analyzing a subset of experiments that focus not just on whether syntactic priming exists but on how syntactic priming is moderated by other variables (such as repetition of words in prime and target, the location of the testing room, the memory of the speaker, etc.), we found that such studies are, on average, underpowered with estimated average power of 36{\%}. Using a subset of 45 papers from our sample for which we received raw data, we estimated subject and item variation and give recommendations for appropriate sample size for future syntactic priming studies.},

abstract = {Converging findings from behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging studies suggest an integration-to-boundary mechanism governing decision formation and choice selection. This mechanism is supported by sequential sampling models of choice decisions, which can implement statistically optimal decision strategies for selecting between multiple alternative options on the basis of sensory evidence. This review focuses on recent developments in understanding the evidence boundary, an important component of decision-making raised by experimental findings and models. The article starts by reviewing the neurobiology of perceptual decisions and several influential sequential sampling models, in particular the drift-diffusion model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model and the leaky-competing-accumulator model. In the second part, the article examines how the boundary may affect a model's dynamics and performance and to what extent it may improve a model's fits to experimental data. In the third part, the article examines recent findings that support the presence and site of boundaries in the brain. The article considers two questions: (1) whether the boundary is a spontaneous property of neural integrators, or is controlled by dedicated neural circuits; (2) if the boundary is variable, what could be the driving factors behind boundary changes? The review brings together studies using different experimental methods in seeking answers to these questions, highlights psychological and physiological factors that may be associated with the boundary and its changes, and further considers the evidence boundary as a generic mechanism to guide complex behavior.},

abstract = {The reliability of acceptability judgments made by individual linguists has often been called into question. Recent large-scale replication studies conducted in response to this criticism have shown that the majority of published English acceptability judgments are robust. We make two observations about these replication studies. First, we raise the concern that English acceptability judgments may be more reliable than judgments in other languages. Second, we argue that it is unnecessary to replicate judgments that illustrate uncontroversial descriptive facts; rather, candidates for replication can emerge during formal or informal peer review. We present two experiments motivated by these arguments. Published Hebrew and Japanese acceptability contrasts considered questionable by the authors of the present paper were rated for acceptability by a large sample of naive participants. Approximately half of the contrasts did not replicate. We suggest that the reliability of acceptability judgments, especially in languages other than English, can be improved using a simple open review system, and that formal experiments are only necessary in controversial cases.},

abstract = {We show that online processing difficulties induced by word order variations in German cannot be attributed to the relative infrequency of the constructions in question, but rather appear to reflect the application of grammatical principles during parsing. Event-related brain potentials revealed that dative-marked objects in the initial position of an embedded sentence do not elicit a neurophysiologically distinct response from subjects, whereas accusative-marked objects do. These differences are predictable on the basis of grammatical distinctions (i.e. underlying linguistic properties), but not on the basis of frequency information (i.e. a superficial linguistic property). We therefore conclude that the former, but not the latter, guides syntactic integration during online parsing.},

@inproceedings{Araujo2001,
abstract = {Saccadic eye movements are usually assumed to be directed to locations containing important or useful information, but such assumptions fail to take into account that planning saccades to such locations might be too costly in terms of effort or attention required. To investigate costs of saccadic planning, subjects searched for a target letter that was contained in either one of two clusters located on either side of a central fixation target. A target was present on each trial and was more likely (probability = 0.8) to appear in one cluster than the other. Probabilities were disclosed by differences in cluster intensities. The distance between each cluster and central fixation varied (60???-300???). The presentation time was limited (500 ms) to ensure that a successful search would require a wisely chosen saccadic plan. The best chance of finding the target would be to direct the first saccade to the high-probability location, but only one of the six subjects tested followed this strategy consistently. The rest (to varying degrees) preferred to aim the first saccade to the closer location, often followed by an attempted search of the remaining location. Two-location searches were unsuccessful; performance at both locations was poor due to insufficient time. Preferences for such ineffective strategies were surprising. They suggest that saccadic plans were influenced by attempts to minimize the cognitive and attentional load attached to planning and to maximize the number of new foveal views that can be acquired in a limited period of time. These strategies, though disastrous in our task, may be crucial in natural scanning, when many cognitive operations are performed at once, and the risk attached to a few errant glances at unimportant places is small. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Both Experiments 1 and 2 showed reduced effects of preview on regressions out for sentence-initial words. In addition, Experiment 2 showed reduced preview effects on first-pass reading times for sentence-initial words. These effects of sentence position on preview could result from either reduced parafoveal processing for sentence-initial words or other processes specific to word reading at sentence boundaries. In addition to the effects of preview, the experiments also demonstrate variability in the effects of sentence wrap-up on different reading measures, indicating that the presence and time course of wrap-up effects may be modulated by text-specific factors. We also report simulations of Experiment 2 using version 10 of E-Z Reader (Reichle, Warren, {\&} McConnell, 2009), designed to explore the possible mechanisms underlying parafoveal preview at sentence boundaries.},

abstract = {Empirical work and models of visual word recognition have traditionally focused on group-level performance. Despite the emphasis on the prototypical reader, there is clear evidence that variation in reading skill modulates word recognition performance. In the present study, we examined differences among individuals who contributed to the English Lexicon Project (http://elexicon.wustl.edu), an online behavioral database containing nearly 4 million word recognition (speeded pronunciation and lexical decision) trials from over 1,200 participants. We observed considerable within- and between-session reliability across distinct sets of items, in terms of overall mean response time (RI), RI distributional characteristics, diffusion model parameters (Ratcliff, Gomez, {\&} McKoon, 2004), and sensitivity to underlying lexical dimensions. This indicates reliably detectable individual differences in word recognition performance. In addition, higher vocabulary knowledge was associated with faster, more accurate word recognition performance, attenuated sensitivity to stimuli characteristics, and more efficient accumulation of information. Finally, in contrast to suggestions in the literature, we did not find evidence that individuals were trading-off their utilization of lexical and nonlexical information.},

abstract = {An event-related brain potentials experiment was carried out to examine the interplay of referential and structural factors during sentence processing in discourse. Subjects read (Dutch) sentences beginning like David told the girl that... in short story contexts that had introduced either one or two referents for a critical singular noun phrase (the girl). The waveforms showed that within 280 ms after onset of the critical noun the reader had already determined whether the noun phrase had a unique referent in earlier discourse. Furthermore, this referential information was immediately used in parsing the rest of the sentence, which was briefly ambiguous between a complement clause (... that there would be some visitors) and a relative clause (... that had been on the phone to hang up). A consistent pattern of P600/SPS effects elicited by various subsequent disambiguations revealed that a two-referent discourse context had led the parser to initially pursue the relative-clause alternative to a larger extent than a one-referent context. Together, the results suggest that during the processing of sentences in discourse, structural and referential sources of information interact on a word-by-word basis.},

abstract = {This paper is intended to lay out for broader discussion some arguments for the im- portance of data in work in generative syntax. These are accepted by many linguists, but a significant number of others still seem reluctant to accept them. The basic claim is that it is no longer tenable for syntactic theories to be constructed on the evidence of a single persons judgements, and that real progress can only be made when syntacticians begin to think more carefully about the empirical basis of their work and apply the minimum standards we propose. We advance two groups of rea- sons for syntacticians to do this, negative and positive. The negative stick group concerns the inadequacy of current practice. We argue that linguists are producing unsatisfactory work with these methods. Data quality is a limiting factor: a theory can only ever be as good as its data base. The positive carrot group concerns the descriptive and theoretical advantages which become available with more empiri- cally adequate data. We hope to tempt linguists to adopt new methods by showing them the insights which better data makes available.},

Results of the tests of these hypotheses suggest that process architecture and the stopping rule do not distinguish the processing of meaningful and meaningless forms. The major distinction between configural and nonconfigural processing was with regard to processing capacity, potentially implicating channel interdependencies.

abstract = {A large, single-frame, visual-memory search experiment is reported in which memory and display loads of 1, 2, and 4 alphanumeric characters were factorially combined. In addition to the usual Consistent Mapping and Varied Mapping conditions, the experiment also involved a Categorical Varied Mapping condition in which different sets of stimuli switched roles as targets and distractors over trials. The stimuli used in these various mapping conditions were either digits, letters, or digits and letters. Analyses of the response time means obtained early and late in training suggest that the presence of categorical distinctions among the stimuli is the most important determinant of search efficiency. Comparison of the load effects on the response time means and on their standard deviations revealed a fairly constant ratio throughout the experimental conditions, which suggests that similar search processes may have been involved. A feature-based comparison model is indeed shown to account for the response time means obtained after extensive training under just about all training conditions, as well as for the ratios of load effects on means and standard deviations. According to the model, improvement in search efficiency results from a reduction in the number of features considered. The model's performance questions the necessity to postulate qualitative differences between controlled and automatic processing, while the experiment forces a reassessment of the importance of the consistent mapping that underlies dual-process theories.},

This article shows that head-final structures derive the correct scope readings in scrambled clauses in a straightforward and consistent man- ner, whereas head-initial structures require more complicated and sometimes contradictory assumptions.

abstract = {Two eye movement while reading experiments address the issue of how reading of an unpredictable word is influenced by the presence of a more predictable alternative. The experiments replicate the robust effects of predictability on the probability of skipping and on early and late reading time measures. However, in both experiments, an unpredictable but plausible word was read no more slowly when another word was highly predictable (i.e., in a constraining context) than when no word was highly predictable (i.e., in a neutral context). In fact, an unpredictable word that was semantically related to the predictable alternative demonstrated facilitation in the constraining context, in relatively late eye movement measures. These results, which are consistent with Luke and Christianson's (2016) corpus study, provide the first evidence from a controlled experimental design for the absence of a prediction error cost, and for facilitation of an unpredictable but semantically related word, during normal reading. The findings support a model of lexical predictability effects in which there is broad pre-activation of potential continuations, rather than discrete predictions of specific lexical items. Importantly, pre-activation of likely continuations does not result in processing difficulty when some other word is actually encountered.},

abstract = {Research on interference has provided evidence that the formation of dependencies between non-adjacent words relies on a cue-based retrieval mechanism. Two different models can account for one of the main predictions of interference, i.e., a slowdown at a retrieval site, when several items share a feature associated with a retrieval cue: Lewis and Vasishth's (2005) activation-based model and McElree's (2000) direct access model. Even though these two models have been used almost interchangeably, they are based on different assumptions and predict differences in the relationship between reading times and response accuracy. The activation-based model follows the assumptions of ACT-R, and its retrieval process behaves as a lognormal race between accumulators of evidence with a single variance. Under this model, accuracy of the retrieval is determined by the winner of the race and retrieval time by its rate of accumulation. In contrast, the direct access model assumes a model of memory where only the probability of retrieval varies between items; in this model, differences in latencies are a by-product of the possibility and repairing incorrect retrievals. We implemented both models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework in order to evaluate them and compare them. We show that some aspects of the data are better fit under the direct access model than under the activation-based model. We suggest that this finding does not rule out the possibility that retrieval may be behaving as a race model with assumptions that follow less closely the ones from the ACT-R framework. We show that by introducing a modification of the activation model, i.e, by assuming that the accumulation of evidence for retrieval of incorrect items is not only slower but noisier (i.e., different variances for the correct and incorrect items), the model can provide a fit as good as the one of the direct access model.},

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

In this article, we review the original argument for GE processing, and we present new evidence that supports the concept: first, local interpretations are computed, which can interfere with global ones; second, new findings based on the recording of event-related potentials show the use of simple heuristics rather than compositional algorithms for constructing sentence meaning; and recent studies show that the comprehension system has mechanisms for handling disfluencies, but they work imperfectly. We argue that the GE approach to language comprehension is similar to the use of fast and frugal heuristics for decision-making, and that future research should explore this connection more thoroughly.},

abstract = {To contrast mechanisms of lexical access in production versus comprehension we compared the effects of word frequency (high, low), context (none, low constraint, high constraint), and level of English proficiency (monolingual, Spanish-English bilingual, Dutch-English bilingual) on picture naming, lexical decision, and eye fixation times. Semantic constraint effects were larger in production than in reading. Frequency effects were larger in production than in reading without constraining context but larger in reading than in production with constraining context. Bilingual disadvantages were modulated by frequency in production but not in eye fixation times, were not smaller in low-constraint contexts, and were reduced by high-constraint contexts only in production and only at the lowest level of English proficiency. These results challenge existing accounts of bilingual disadvantages and reveal fundamentally different processes during lexical access across modalities, entailing a primarily semantically driven search in production but a frequency-driven search in comprehension. The apparently more interactive process in production than comprehension could simply reflect a greater number of frequency-sensitive processing stages in production.},

abstract = {The dominant paradigm for inference in psychology is a null-hypothesis significance testing one. Recently, the foundations of this paradigm have been shaken by several notable replication failures. One recommendation to remedy the replication crisis is to collect larger samples of participants. We argue that this recommendation misses a critical point, which is that increasing sample size will not remedy psychology's lack of strong measurement, lack of strong theories and models, and lack of effective experimental control over error variance. In contrast, there is a long history of research in psychology employing small-N designs that treats the individual participant as the replication unit, which addresses each of these failings, and which produces results that are robust and readily replicated. We illustrate the properties of small-N and large-N designs using a simulated paradigm investigating the stage structure of response times. Our simulations highlight the high power and inferential validity of the small-N design, in contrast to the lower power and inferential indeterminacy of the large-N design. We argue that, if psychology is to be a mature quantitative science, then its primary theoretical aim should be to investigate systematic, functional relationships as they are manifested at the individual participant level and that, wherever possible, it should use methods that are optimized to identify relationships of this kind.},

abstract = {Ferreira and Clifton (1986, Experiment 1) found that readers experienced equal difficulty with temporarily ambiguous reduced relatives clauses when the first noun was animate (e.g., The defendant examined by the lawyer was . . and when it was inanimate and thus an unlikely Agent (e.g., The evidence examined . . .). This data pattern suggested that a verb's semantic constraints do not affect initial syntactic ambiguity resolution. We repeated the experiment using: (1) inanimate noun/verb combinations that did not easily permit a main clause continuation, (2) a baseline condition with morphologically unambiguous verbs (e.g., stolen), (3) a homogeneous set of disambiguating prepositional phrases, and (4) a display in which all of the critical regions were presented on the same line of text. In two eye-movement experiments, animacy had immediate effects on ambiguity resolution: only animate nouns showed clear signs of difficulty. Post-hoc regression analyses revealed that what little processing difficulty readers had with the inanimate nouns varied with the semantic fit of individual noun/verb combinations: items with strong semantic fit showed no processing difficulty compared to unambiguous controls, whereas items with weak semantic fit showed a pattern of processing difficulty which was similar to Ferreira and Clifton (1986). The results are interpreted within the framework of an evidential (constraint-based) approach to ambiguity resolution. Analyses of reading times also suggested that the millisecond per character correction for region length is problematic, especially for small scoring regions. An alternative transformation is suggested.},

This review examines probabilistic models defined over traditional symbolic structures. Language comprehension and production involve probabilistic inference in such models; and acquisition involves choosing the best model, given innate constraints and linguistic and other input. Probabilistic models can account for the learning and processing of language, while maintaining the sophistication of symbolic models. A recent burgeoning of theoretical developments and online corpus creation has enabled large models to be tested, revealing probabilistic constraints in processing, undermining acquisition arguments based on a perceived poverty of the stimulus, and suggesting fruitful links with probabilistic theories of categorization and ambiguity resolution in perception. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A speeded-grammaticality judgment experiment and two self-paced reading experiments were conducted involving number ambiguous subjects in German verb-end clauses. Number preferences for individual nouns were estimated by means of two questionnaire studies and a corpus analysis. The data show garden-path effects for locally ambiguous sentences, suggesting that readers resolved the number ambiguity immediately. Substantial correlations between experimental results and results from the norming studies indicate that the choice of either singular or plural is determined by exposure-based lexical preferences. We discuss the implications of our results for the relationship between lexical and syntactic processing, in particular with regard to the costs incurred by revising earlier lexical decisions. In addition, we address two methodological issues: first, the appropriate way to obtain lexical preferences, and second, the measurement of garden-path effects in verb-end sentences disambiguated by the final word. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {During natural speech perception, listeners rely on a wide range of cues to support comprehension, from semantic context to prosodic information. There is a general consensus that prosody plays a role in syntactic parsing, but most studies focusing on ambiguous relative clauses show that prosodic cues, alone, are insufficient to reverse the preferred interpretation of sentence. These findings suggest that universally preferred structures (e.g. Late Closure principle) matter far more than prosodic cues in such cases. This study explores an alternative hypothesis: that the weak effect of prosody might be due to the influence of various syntactic, lexical-semantic, and acoustic confounding factors, and investigate the consequences of prosodic breaks while controlling these variables. We used Spanish relative clause sentences in three experimental conditions where the presence and position (following the first or second noun phrase) of prosodic breaks was manipulated. The results showed that the placement of a prosodic break determined sentence interpretation by changing the preferred attachment of the relative clause. Listeners' natural preference for low attachment (in the absence of break) was reinforced when a prosodic break was placed after the first noun. In contrast, a prosodic break placed after the second noun reversed the preferred interpretation of the sentence, towards high attachment. We argue that, in addition to other factors, listeners indeed use prosodic breaks as robust cues to syntactic parsing during speech processing, as these cues may direct listeners toward one interpretation or another.},

abstract = {This study describes an analytical model of the visual lex-ical decision (VLD) task. The task is modeled as a prob-lem of hypothesis testing given noisy evidence using a gen-eral Bayesian framework, similar to several previously pub-lished models. The Bayesian formulation is then shown to reduce to a Geometric Brownian Motion with a drift and an infinitesimal variance (a Drift-Diffusion Model). In turn, this reduction enables the use of direct analytical techniques – in-stead of simulations – to understand the different factors that influence response latencies. We demonstrate the power of this technique by analyzing the individual response latencies to a realistic size vocabulary covering virtually the full English lexicon. The model achieves an accurate prediction of the re-sponse latencies and error scores to thousands of individual words in relation to previously published VLD data. Crucially, this approach enables a direct explanation of several known non-linear effects, directly addressing their underlying math-ematical explanation in a level of detail that is not attainable using traditional simulation-based approaches.},

abstract = {Unedited speech and writing often contains errors, e.g., the blending of alternative ways of expressing a message. As a result comprehenders are faced with decisions about what the speaker may have intended, which may not be the same as the grammatically-licensed compositional interpretation of what was said. Two experiments investigated the comprehension of inputs that may have resulted from blending two syntactic forms. The results of the experiments suggest that readers and listeners tend to repair such utterances, restoring them to the presumed intended structure, and they assign the interpretation of the corrected utterance. Utterances that are repaired are expected to also be acceptable when they are easy to diagnose/repair and they are 'familiar', i.e., they correspond to natural speech errors. The results of the experiments established a continuum ranging from outright linguistic illusions with no indication that listeners and readers detected the error (the inclusion of almost in A passerby rescued a child from almost being run over by a bus.), to a majority of unblended interpretations for doubled quantifier sentences (Many students often turn in their assignments late) to only a third undoubled implicit negation (I just like the way the president looks without his shirt off.)

The paper proposes a simple information-theoretic characterization of processing difficulty as the work incurred by resource reallocation during parallel, incremental, probabilistic disambiguation in sentence comprehension, and demonstrates its equivalence to the theory of Hale [Hale, J. (2001). A probabilistic Earley parser as a psycholinguistic model. In Proceedings of NAACL (Vol. 2, pp. 159-166)], in which the difficulty of a word is proportional to its surprisal (its negative log-probability) in the context within which it appears. This proposal subsumes and clarifies findings that high-constraint contexts can facilitate lexical processing, and connects these findings to well-known models of parallel constraint-based comprehension. In addition, the theory leads to a number of specific predictions about the role of expectation in syntactic comprehension, including the reversal of locality-based difficulty patterns in syntactically constrained contexts, and conditions under which increased ambiguity facilitates processing. The paper examines a range of established results bearing on these predictions, and shows that they are largely consistent with the surprisal theory. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Words, like musical notes, are grouped together into phrases by their rhythmic and durational properties as well as their tonal pitch. This 'prosodic phrasing' affects the understanding of sentences. Many processing studies of prosody have investigated sentences with a single, grammatically required prosodic boundary, which might be interpreted strictly locally, as a signal to end the current syntactic unit. Recent results suggest, however, that the global pattern of prosodic phrasing is what matters in sentence comprehension, not just the occurrence or size of a single local boundary. In this article we claim that the impact of prosodic boundaries depends on the other prosodic choices a speaker has made. We speculate that prosody serves to hold distinct linguistic representations together in memory. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

annote = {The secondary task did not have to be reading related for the span to predict reading comprehension.Simple digit and word spans (measured with- out a background task) did not correlate with reading comprehension and SAT scores.Presumably, the limited capac- ity of short-term memory affects our per- formance in cognitive tasks like reading or listening comprehension and general prob- lem solving (Kintsch {\{}{\&}{\}} van Dijk, 1978; Newell {\{}{\&}{\}} Simon, 1972).Baddeley {\{}{\&}{\}} Hitch (1974)preferred the name work-ing memory and argued for the importanceof both storage and processing in a func- tional analysis of the working memory sys- tem.After each group, the subject recalled the ``endwords'' in any order.WM capacity was defined as the largest group of endwords the subjects recalled correctly.Pre- sumably good and poor readers have equiv- alent overall working memory capacities.Daneman and Carpenter (1980) found high correlations between reading span and three measures of reading comprehension; (1) answering fact ques- tions (r = .72), (2) pronoun reference ques- tions (r = .90), and (3) the Verbal Scholas- tic Aptitude Test (Exp. 1, r = .59, Exp. 2, r = .49).Good readers are assumed to have efficient reading skills which demand relatively little from the gross WM resources leaving more of the WM capacity for the storage of prod- ucts of the reading task. Consequently, good readers have more WM capacity available for the storage of products simply because they have more efficient reading skills.A similar correlation (r = -53) between WM span and the Nelson- Denny, a standardized test of reading com- prehension, was found by Masson and Miller (1983).Daneman and col- leagues argued that the reading span is an index of the WM capacity that is NOT al- located to processing (i.e., reading and comprehending) the individual sentences.Span measures embedded in a processing task other than reading correlated with reading comprehension just as well as did the reading span.neman and Carpenter findings, however, may be that people are good readers be- cause they have a large WM capacity inde- pendent of the task being performed. Good readers may be remembering morenumber of items (digits/words) recalled. The main pur- pose of this pilot study was tnot need to be reading related to lead to a correlation between the span measure and a test of reading comprehension.

abstract = {Cue-based retrieval theories in sentence processing predict two classes of interference effect: (i) Inhibitory interference is predicted when multiple items match a retrieval cue: cue-overloading leads to a decrease in the probability of retrieving the correct target; and (ii) Facilitatory interference arises when a retrieval target as well as a distractor only partially match the retrieval cues; this partial matching leads to an overall speedup in retrieval time. Inhibitory interference effects are widely observed, but facilitatory interference apparently has an exception: reflexives have been claimed to show no facilitatory interference effects. Because the finding is based on underpowered studies, we conducted a large-sample experiment that investigated both facilitatory and inhibitory interference. In contrast to previous studies, we find facilitatory interference effects in reflexives. We also present a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of a cue-based retrieval model (Engelmann et al., 2019, available as a Shiny App: https://engelmann.shinyapps.io/inter-act/) with respect to the large-sample data.},

This note discusses four important classes of serial and parallel models: simple limited parallel, ranked limited parallel, deterministic serial with reanalysis, and probabilistic serial with reanalysis. It is argued that existing evidence is compatible only with probabilistic serial-reanalysis models, or ranked parallel models augmented with a reanalysis component. A new class of linguistic structures is introduced on which the behavior of serial and parallel parsers diverge the most radically: multiple local ambiguities are stacked to increase the number of viable alternatives in the ambiguous region from two to eight structures. This paradigm may provide the strongest test yet for parallel models.},

Part I of this series outlined several advantages of Bayesian hypothesis testing, including the ability to quantify evidence and the ability to monitor and update this evidence as data come in, without the need to know the intention with which the data were collected. Despite these and other practical advantages, Bayesian hypothesis tests are still reported relatively rarely. An important impediment to the widespread adoption of Bayesian tests is arguably the lack of user-friendly software for the run-of-the-mill statistical problems that confront psychologists for the analysis of almost every experiment: the t-test, ANOVA, correlation, regression, and contingency tables. In Part II of this series we introduce JASP (http://www.jasp-stats.org), an open-source, cross-platform, user-friendly graphical software package that allows users to carry out Bayesian hypothesis tests for standard statistical problems. JASP is based in part on the Bayesian analyses implemented in Morey and Rouder's BayesFactor package for R. Armed with JASP, the practical advantages of Bayesian hypothesis testing are only a mouse click away.},

While the first two experiments established reliable repetition of RC attachments between primes and targets, Experiment 3 failed to obtain a significant priming effect, indicating that RC attachment priming is dependent on a syntactic overlap between primes and targets. The results suggest a tendency of language producers to retain hierarchical syntactic relations over consecutive trials.

abstract = {Two story-telling experiments examine the process of choosing between pronouns and proper names in speaking. Such choices are traditionally attributed to speakers striving to make referring expressions maximally interpretable to addressees. The experiments revealed a novel effect: even when a pronoun would not be ambiguous, the presence of another character in the discourse decreased pronoun use and increased latencies to refer to the most prominent character in the discourse. In other words, speakers were more likely to call Minnie Minnie than she when Donald was also present. Even when the referent character appeared alone in the stimulus picture, the presence of another character in the preceding discourse reduced pronouns. Furthermore, pronoun use varied with features associated with the speaker's degree of focus on the preceding discourse (e.g., narrative style and disfluency). We attribute this effect to competition for attentional resources in the speaker's representation of the discourse. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Concentrating on the real patterns of use in modern Turkish, it presents a detailed and systematic description of the structure of language at every level - sounds, words and sentences - and will remain the standard reference work for years to come. Drawing upon a rapidly growing body of scholarly research on Turkish, this well-presented Grammar is a stimulating and up-to-date analysis of the complexities of the language, with full and clear explanations and examples throughout. A detailed index and extensive cross-referencing between numbered subsections also provides readers with easy access to the information they require. The features include: detailed treatment of common grammatical structures and parts of speech; extensive use of examples, all with English translations; particular attention to areas of confusion and difficulty; and a comprehensive glossary of all grammatical terms. The "Grammar" is an essential reference source for intermediate and advanced learners and users of Turkish.},

abstract = {The ungrammatical sentence "The key to the cabinets are on the table" is known to lead to an illusion of grammaticality. As discussed in the meta-analysis by Jaeger et al., 2017, faster reading times are observed at the verb are in the agreement-attraction sentence above compared to the equally ungrammatical sentence "The key to the cabinet are on the table". One explanation for this facilitation effect is the feature percolation account: the plural feature on cabinets percolates up to the head noun key, leading to the illusion. An alternative account is in terms of cue-based retrieval (Lewis {\&} Vasishth, 2005), which assumes that the non-subject noun cabinets is misretrieved due to a partial feature-match when a dependency completion process at the auxiliary initiates a memory access for a subject with plural marking. We present evidence for yet another explanation for the observed facilitation. Because the second sentence has two nouns with identical number, it is possible that these are, in some proportion of trials, more difficult to keep distinct, leading to slower reading times at the verb in the first sentence above; this is the feature overwriting account of Nairne, 1990. We show that the feature overwriting proposal can be implemented as a finite mixture process. We reanalysed ten published data-sets, fitting hierarchical Bayesian mixture models to these data assuming a two-mixture distribution. We show that in nine out of the ten studies, a mixture distribution corresponding to feature overwriting furnishes a superior fit over both the feature percolation and the cue-based retrieval accounts.},

In all cases, interresponse times (IRTs [i.e., inspection times per word]) were recorded during reading. Results show that patterns of word-by-word reading times varied for the same materials depending on their mode of presentation, confirming previous findings by M. A. Just et al (see record 1982-29564-001). In the cumulative mode, Ss were sensitive to syntactic ambiguity. This was not true in the central presentation. The spatial location mode produced patterns of IRTs that resembled those in the central mode, apart from the tendency to spend longer on the final word. Data suggest that appropriate syntactic processing may critically depend on the reader's ability to reinspect portions of the text. This conclusion was further supported by direct observation of the reader's eye movement as the task was performed. The experimental items and questions are appended.},

abstract = {A series of experiments explored a form of object-specific priming. In all experiments a preview field containing two or more letters is followed by a target letter that is to be named. The displays are designed to produce a perceptual interpretation of the target as a new state of an object that previously contained one of the primes. The link is produced in different experiments by a shared location, by a shared relative position in a moving pattern, or by successive appearance in the same moving frame. An object-specific advantage is consistently observed: naming is facilitated by a preview of the target, if (and in some cases only if) the two appearances are linked to the same object. The amount and the object specificity of the preview benefit are not affected by extending the preview duration to 1 s, or by extending the temporal gap between fields to 590 ms. The results are interpreted in terms of a reviewing process, which is triggered by the appearance of the target and retrieves just one of the previewed items. In the absence of an object link, the reviewing item is selected at random. We develop the concept of an object file as a temporary episodic representation, within which successive states of an object are linked and integrated. ?? 1992.},

Russian uses the Cyrillic script, which has not yet been investigated in cross-linguistic eye movement research. As in every language studied so far, we confirmed the expected effects of low-level parameters, such as word length, frequency, and predictability, on the eye movements of skilled Russian readers. These findings allow us to add Slavic languages using Cyrillic script (exemplified by Russian) to the growing number of languages with different orthographies, ranging from the Roman-based European languages to logographic Asian ones, whose basic eye movement benchmarks conform to the universal comparative science of reading (Share, 2008). We additionally report basic descriptive corpus statistics and three exploratory investigations of the effects of Russian morphology on the basic eye movement measures, which illustrate the kinds of questions that researchers can answer using the RSC. The annotated corpus is freely available from its project page at the Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/x5q2r/.},

abstract = {Techniques for measuring cerebral perfusion require accurate longitudinal relaxation (T1) of blood, a MRI parameter that is field dependent. T1 of arterial and venous human blood was measured at 7T using three different sources – pathology laboratory, blood bank and in vivo. The T1 of venous blood was measured from sealed samples from a pathology lab and in vivo. Samples from a blood bank were oxygenated and mixed to obtain different physiological concentrations of hematocrit and oxygenation. T1 relaxation times were estimated using a three-point fit to a simple inversion recovery equation. At 37° C, the T1 of blood at arterial pO2was 2.29 ± 0.1 s and 2.07 ± 0.12 at venous pO2. The in vivo T1 of venous blood, in three subjects, was slightly longer at 2.45 ± 0.11s. T1 of arterial and venous blood at 7T was measured and found to be significantly different. The T1 values were longer in vivo than in vitro. While the exact cause for the discrepancy is unknown, the additives in the blood samples, degradation during experiment, oxygenation differences, and the non-stagnant nature of blood in vivo could be potential contributors to the lower values of T1 in the venous samples.

In the sentence The boy that the teacher warned fell, boy is readily interpreted as the subject of the verb fall despite the fact that a relative clause, that the teacher warned, intervenes between the two dependent elements. We review research investigating three memory operations proposed for resolving this and other types of non-adjacent dependencies: serial search retrieval, in which the dependent constituent is recovered by a search process through representations in memory, direct-access retrieval in which the dependent constituent is recovered directly by retrieval cue operations without search, and active maintenance of the dependent constituent in focal attention. Studies using speed-accuracy tradeoff methodology to examine the full timecourse of interpreting a wide range of non-adjacent dependencies indicate that comprehenders retrieve dependent constituents with a direct-access operation, consistent with the claim that representations formed during comprehension are accessed with a cue-driven, content-addressable retrieval process. The observed timecourse profiles are inconsistent with a broad class of models based on several search operations for retrieval. The profiles are also inconsistent with active maintenance of a constituent while concurrently processing subsequent material, and suggest that, with few exceptions, direct-access retrieval is required to process non-adjacent dependencies.},

abstract = {Working memory represents the ability of the brain to hold externally
or internally driven information for relatively short periods of
time. Persistent neuronal activity is the elementary process underlying
working memory but its cellular basis remains unknown. The most widely
accepted hypothesis is that persistent activity is based on synaptic
reverberations in recurrent circuits. The entorhinal cortex in the
parahippocampal region is crucially involved in the acquisition,
consolidation and retrieval of long-term memory traces for which
working memory operations are essential. Here we show that individual
neurons from layer V of the entorhinal cortex-which link the hippocampus
to extensive cortical regions-respond to consecutive stimuli with
graded changes in firing frequency that remain stable after each
stimulus presentation. In addition, the sustained levels of firing
frequency can be either increased or decreased in an input-specific
manner. This firing behaviour displays robustness to distractors;
it is linked to cholinergic muscarinic receptor activation, and relies
on activity-dependent changes of a Ca2+-sensitive cationic current.
Such an intrinsic neuronal ability to generate graded persistent
activity constitutes an elementary mechanism for working memory.},

abstract = {In recent work (Boersma {\&} Hayes 2001), Stochastic Optimality Theory has been used to model grammaticality judgments in exactly the same way as corpus frequencies are modelled, namely as the result of noisy evaluation of constraints ranked along a continuous scale. It has been observed, however, that grammaticality judgments do not necessarily reflect relative corpus frequencies: it is possible that structure A is judged as more grammatical than a competing structure B, whereas at the same time structure B occurs more often in actual language data than structure A. The present paper addresses one of these observations, namely the finding that ‘ideal' forms found in experiments on prototypicality judgments often turn out to be peripheral within the corpus distribution of their grammatical category (Johnson, Flemming {\&} Wright 1993). At first sight one must expect that Stochastic Optimality Theory will have trouble handling such observed discrepancies. The present paper, however, shows that a bidirectional model of phonetic perception and production (Boersma 2005) solves the paradox. In that model, corpus frequency reflects the production process, whereas prototypicality judgments naturally derive from a simpler process, namely the inverted perception process.},

A number of current psycholinguistic theories consider lexical selection as a process related to selecting a lexical target from a number of alternatives, which each have varying activations (or signal supports), that are largely resultant of an initial stimulus recognition. We thoroughly present a case for how such a process may be theoretically explained by the evidence accumulation paradigm, and we demonstrate how this paradigm can be directly related or combined with conventional psycholinguistic theory and their simulatory instantiations (generally, neural network models). Then with a demonstrative application on a large new real data set, we establish how the empirical evidence accumulation approach is able to provide parameter results that are informative to leading psycholinguistic theory, and that motivate future theoretical development.},

abstract = {Readers' eye movements were monitored as they read sentences containing noun-noun compounds that varied in frequency (e.g., elevator mechanic, mountain lion). The left constituent of the compound was either plausible or implausible as a head noun at the point at which it appeared, whereas the compound as a whole was always plausible. When the head noun analysis of the left constituent was implausible, reading times on this word were inflated, beginning with the first fixation. This finding is consistent with previous demonstrations of very rapid effects of plausibility on eye movements. Compound frequency did not modulate the plausibility effect, and all disruption was resolved by the time readers' eyes moved to the next word. These findings suggest (contra Kennison, 2005) that the parser initially analyzes a singular noun as a head instead of a modifier. In addition, the findings confirm that the very rapid effect of plausibility on eye movements is not due to strategic factors, because in the present experiment, unlike in previous demonstrations, this effect appeared in sentences that were globally plausible.},

One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean +/-1 standard deviation. The resulting coefficients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option--an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data file--so that the magnitudes of coefficients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.},

@article{Harris2006,
abstract = {In primates, it is well known that there is a consistent relationship between the duration, peak velocity and amplitude of saccadic eye movements, known as the 'main sequence'. The reason why such a stereotyped relationship evolved is unknown. We propose that a fundamental constraint on the deployment of foveal vision lies in the motor system that is perturbed by signal-dependent noise (proportional noise) on the motor command. This noise imposes a compromise between the speed and accuracy of an eye movement. We propose that saccade trajectories have evolved to optimize a trade-off between the accuracy and duration of the movement. Taking a semi-analytical approach we use Pontryagin's minimum principle to show that there is an optimal trajectory for a given amplitude and duration; and that there is an optimal duration for a given amplitude. It follows that the peak velocity is also fixed for a given amplitude. These predictions are in good agreement with observed saccade trajectories and the main sequence. Moreover, this model predicts a small saccadic dead-zone in which it is better to stay eccentric of target than make a saccade onto target. We conclude that the main sequence has evolved as a strategy to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and speed.},

The speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) effect refers to the behavioral trade-off between fast yet error-prone respones and accurate but slow responses. Multiple theories on the cognitive mechanisms behind SAT exist. One theory assumes that SAT is a consequence of strategically adjusting the amount of evidence required for overt behaviors, such as perceptual choices. Another theory hypothesizes that SAT is the consequence of the mixture of multiple categorically different cognitive processes. In this paper, these theories are disambiguated by assessing whether the fixed-point property of mixture distributions holds, in both simulations and data. I conclude that, at least for perceptual decision making, there is no evidence for a mixture of different cognitive processes to trade off accuracy of responding for speed.},

abstract = {Recognition memory z-transformed Receiver Operating Characteristic (zROC) functions have a slope less than 1. One way to accommodate this finding is to assume that memory evidence is more variable for studied (old) items than non-studied (new) items. This assumption has been implemented in signal detection models, but this approach cannot accommodate the time course of decision making. We tested the unequal-variance assumption by fitting the diffusion model to accuracy and response time (RT) distributions from nine old/new recognition data sets comprising previously-published data from 376 participants. The $\eta$ parameter in the diffusion model measures between-trial variability in evidence based on accuracy and the RT distributions for correct and error responses. In fits to nine data sets, $\eta$ estimates were higher for targets than lures in all cases, and fitting results rejected an equal-variance version of the model in favor of an unequal-variance version. Parameter recovery simulations showed that the variability differences were not produced by biased estimation of the $\eta$ parameter. Estimates of the other model parameters were largely consistent between the equal- and unequal-variance versions of the model. Our results provide independent support for the unequal-variance assumption without using zROC data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

Specifically, grammatical properties may be observed more often across languages because they improve a language's utility or decrease its complexity . While this approach to the study of typology offers the potential of explaining grammatical patterns in terms of general principles rather than domain-specific constraints, the notions of utility and complexity are more often grounded in intuition than empirical findings. A suitable empirical foundation might be found in the terms of processing preferences: in that case, psycholin- guistic measures of complexity are then expected correlate with typological patterns. We summarize half a century of psycholinguistic work on ‘processing complexity'inanattempttomakethisworkaccessibletoabroaderaudience: What makes something hard to process for comprehenders, and what determines speakers' preferences in production? We also briefly discuss recently emerging approaches that link preferences in production to communicative efficiency. These approaches can be seen as providing well- defined measures of utility. With these psycholinguistic findings in mind, it is possible to investigate the extent to which language usage is reflected in typological patterns. We close with a summary of paradigms that allow the link between language usage and typology to be studied empirically},

abstract = {When saccades are evoked by suddenly presented visual stimuli, the stochastic distribution of their reaction times is typically recinormal, in conformity with the LATER model of decision-making, sometimes with an additional sub-population of early responses. In the real world, saccades are more often spontaneous responses to static features of the visual world; nevertheless, the time between the end of one saccade and the start of the next may be regarded as a reaction time to the new image that is presented to the retina. The distribution of these times is qualitatively similar to that of evoked saccades, but typically with a longer median and more of the early responses. Here, we analyse the statistical distributions of fixation times from a large database of spontaneous saccades made while reading and show that the distributions are altered in characteristic ways by particular features of the current fixation: likely familiarity of the currently fixated word, and its proximity to the preceding fixation. These alterations are of the kind predicted by LATER: familiarity appears to influence the mean rate at which the decision signal approaches completion, whereas proximity to the previous fixation, presumably because it provides partial prior information about the upcoming word, appears to increase prior probability. We conclude that spontaneous saccades may be successfully described by the same decision-making model that can be used for evoked ones.},

abstract = {Abstract. An ecient method for the exact numericalsimulation of semi-Markov
processes is used to studyminimal models of the control of eye movements
inreading. When we read a text, typical sequences of{\textregistered}xations form
a rather complicated trajectory ± almostlike a random walk. Mathematical
models of eyemovement control can account for this behavior usingstochastic
transition rules between few discrete internalstates, which represent
combinations of certain stages oflexical access and saccade programs.
We show thatexperimentally observed {\textregistered}xation durations can beexplained
by residence-time-dependent transition prob-abilities. Stochastic
processes with this property areknown as semi-Markov processes. For
our numericalsimulations we use the minimal process method (Gilles-pie
algorithm), which is an exact and ecient simulationalgorithm for
this class of stochastic processes. Withinthis mathematical framework,
we study dierent formsof coupling between eye movements and shifts
of covertattention in reading. Our model lends support to theexistence
of autonomous saccades, i.e., the hypothesisthat initiations of saccades
are not completely determined by lexical access processes.},

abstract = {This paper is an introduction to model selection intended for nonspecialists who have knowledge of the statistical concepts covered in a typical first (occasionally second) statistics course. The intention is to explain the ideas that generate frequentist methodology for model selection, for example the Akaike information criterion, bootstrap criteria, and cross-validation criteria. Bayesian methods, including the Bayesian information criterion, are also mentioned in the context of the framework outlined in the paper. The ideas are illustrated using an example in which observations are available for the entire population of interest. This enables us to examine and to measure effects that are usually invisible, because in practical applications only a sample from the population is observed. The problem of selection bias, a hazard of which one needs to be aware in the context of model selection, is also discussed. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

In an event-related brain potential (ERP) experiment, subjects heard Dutch stories that supported the prediction of a specific noun. To probe whether this noun was anticipated at a preceding indefinite article, stories were continued with a gender-marked adjective whose suffix mismatched the upcoming noun's syntactic gender. Prediction-inconsistent adjectives elicited a differential ERP effect, which disappeared in a no-discourse control experiment. Furthermore, in self-paced reading, prediction-inconsistent adjectives slowed readers down before the noun. These findings suggest that people can indeed predict upcoming words in fluent discourse and, moreover, that these predicted words can immediately begin to participate in incremental parsing operations.},

However, Hsiao and Gibson (2003) report an OR preference for Chinese, a finding that has been contested. Here we report faster OR versus SR processing in Basque, an ergative, head-final language with pre-nominal relative clauses. A self-paced reading task was used in Experiments 1 and 2, while ERPs were recorded in Experiment 3. We used relative clauses that were ambiguous between an object or subject-gap interpretation and disambiguated later in the sentence. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 showed that SR took longer to read than OR in the critical disambiguating region. In addition, Experiment 3 showed that SR produced larger amplitudes than OR in the P600 window immediately after reading the critical disambiguating word. Our results suggest that SR are not universally easier to process. They cast doubts on universal hypotheses and suggest that processing complexity may depend on language-specific aspects of grammar. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

(Experiment 1) or 'the man will drink all of ...' or 'the man has drunk all of ...' (Experiment 2). They viewed a concurrent scene depicting a full glass of beer and an empty wine glass (amongst other things). There were more saccades towards the empty wine glass in the past tensed conditions than in the future tense conditions; the converse pattern obtained for looks towards the full glass of beer. We argue that these anticipatory eye movements reflect sensitivity to objects' affordances, and develop an account of the linkage between language processing and visual attention that can account not only for looks towards named objects, but also for those cases (including anticipatory eye movements) where attention is directed towards objects that are not being named. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Of particular interest were (i) whether each task was capable of revealing processing differences on these sentences and (ii) whether these effects were indicated precisely at the predicted word/region. Although there was considerable overlap in the general pattern of results from the four tasks, there were also clear differences among them in terms of the strength and timing of the observed effects. In particular, excepting sentences that tap into clause-closure commitments, both maze task versions provided robust, "localized" indications of incremental sentence processing difficulty relative to self-paced reading and eye tracking.},

Fortunately, as shown by textual analysis of a typical theoretical syntax paper (Li, 1998), syntacticians already recognize the value of proper experimental designs and quantitative analyses, albeit in nascent forms. Small-scale judgment experiments build on this foundation by applying the minimum amount of extra effort needed to draw valid statistical inferences from the type of data most familiar to syntacticians, namely binary judgments involving very few speakers and sentences. Statistical methods appropriate for such data, some hitherto underused, are described, and software tools for automating small-scale judgment experimentation are introduced. The simplicity and power of the methods are then illustrated in a small-scale test of the claims in Li (1998) on naive Chinese speakers. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The range over which one can obtain substantial speed-accuracy tradeoff varies from 150 msec in some very simple perceptual tasks to 1,000 msec in some recognition memory tasks and presumably even longer in more complex cognitive tasks. Obtaining an entire speed-accuracy tradeoff function provides much greater knowledge concerning information processing dynamics than is obtained by a reaction- time experiment, which yields the equivalent of a single point on this function. For this and other reasons, speed-accuracy tradeoff studies are often preferable to reaction-time studies of the dynamics of perceptual, memory, and cognitive processes. Methods of obtaining speed-accuracy tradeoff functions include: instructions, payoffs, deadlines, bands, response signals (with blocked and mixed designs), and partitioning of reaction time. A combination of the mixed-design signal method supplemented by partitioning of reaction times appears to be the optimal method. ?? 1977.},

abstract = {Most models of response time (RT) in elementary cognitive tasks implicitly assume that the speed-accuracy trade-off is continuous: When payoffs or instructions gradually increase the level of speed stress, people are assumed to gradually sacrifice response accuracy in exchange for gradual increases in response speed. This trade-off presumably operates over the entire range from accurate but slow responding to fast but chance-level responding (i.e., guessing). In this article, we challenge the assumption of continuity and propose a phase transition model for RTs and accuracy. Analogous to the fast guess model (Ollman, 1966), our model postulates two modes of processing: a guess mode and a stimulus-controlled mode. From catastrophe theory, we derive two important predictions that allow us to test our model against the fast guess model and against the popular class of sequential sampling models. The first prediction--hysteresis in the transitions between guessing and stimulus-controlled behavior--was confirmed in an experiment that gradually changed the reward for speed versus accuracy. The second prediction--bimodal RT distributions--was confirmed in an experiment that required participants to respond in a way that is intermediate between guessing and accurate responding.},

The noun phrase arguments of the verbs in the sentences were such that when thematic assignment occurred at the critical target word, the sentence was plausible (likely theme), implausible (unlikely theme), or anomalous (an inappropriate theme). Whereas the target word in the anomalous condition provided evidence of immediate disruption, the effect of the target word in the implausible condition was considerably delayed. The results thus indicate that when a word is anomalous, it has an immediate effect on eye movements, but that the effect of implausibility is not as immediate.},

To this end we use event-related potentials to examine the implementation of anaphoric links established between pronouns and non commanding antecedents (discourse- based dependency) and contrast that with the processing of anaphoric links to commanding antecedents (syntax-only dependency). The experimental results obtained show a N400-like effect associated with the formation of the pronoun-non-commanding antecedent dependency. This enhanced negativity for pronouns resolved to non-commanding antecedents supports our hypothesis that discourse-based processes place different computational demands on the comprehension system than syntax-only processes. This kind of evidence is thus consistent with models of pronominal representation whereby antecedents are established by both syntactic and non-syntactic means.},

abstract = {Diffusion models can be used to infer cognitive processes involved in fast binary decision tasks. The model assumes that information is accumulated continuously until one of two thresholds is hit. In the analysis, response time distributions from numerous trials of the decision task are used to estimate a set of parameters mapping distinct cognitive processes. In recent years, diffusion model analyses have become more and more popular in different fields of psychology. This increased popularity is based on the recent development of several software solutions for the parameter estimation. Although these programs make the application of the model relatively easy, there is a shortage of knowledge about different steps of a state-of-the-art diffusion model study. In this paper, we give a concise tutorial on diffusion modeling, and we present fast-dm-30, a thoroughly revised and extended version of the fast-dm software (Voss and Voss, 2007) for diffusion model data analysis. The most important improvement of the fast-dm version is the possibility to choose between different optimization criteria (i.e., Maximum Likelihood, Chi-Square, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov), which differ in applicability for different data sets.},

Participants were presented with 6-item study lists, followed immediately by a recognition probe. A variant of a release from PI design was used: All items in a list were from the same semantic category (e.g., fruits), and the category was changed (e.g., tools) after three consecutive trials with the same category. Analysis of the retrieval functions demonstrated that PI decreased asymptotic accuracy and, crucially, also decreased the growth of accuracy over retrieval time, indicating that PI slowed retrieval speed. Analysis of false alarms to recent negatives (lures drawn from the previous study list) and distant negatives (lures not studied for 168+ trials) suggests that PI slowed retrieval by selectively eliminating fast assessments based on familiarity. There was no evidence indicating that PI affected slow processes involved with the recovery of detailed episodic information. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Two on-line comprehension experiments conducted in the Northern Mariana Islands reveal that the morphological paradigm of wh-agreement affects the timing of dependency formation and interpretation in this language. Overt wh-agreement facilitates the for- mation of a wh-dependency.When overt wh-agreement could occur but does not, however, its ab- sence delays and attenuates wh-dependency formation.

The present study used event-related fMRI to examine the hitherto untested hypothesis that the violation of a linearization principle that is purely semantic in nature (animate arguments should precede inanimate arguments) would also lead to increased pars opercularis activation. To this end, we manipulated the features animacy and argument order in German sentences and found a significant increase of activation in the pars opercularis for a violation of the animacy principle even when the other factors mentioned above were controlled for. This result therefore calls for a "supra-syntactic" account of pars opercularis function in the real-time understanding of sentences.},

The model accounts for data from choice tasks using both time-controlled (e.g., response signal) and standard reaction time paradigms and its adequacy compares favorably with other approaches. A new paradigm that controls the time of arrival of information supporting different choice alternatives provides further support. The model captures choice behavior regardless of the number of alternatives, accounting for the log-linear relation between reaction time and number of alternatives (Hick's law) and explains a complex pattern of visual and contextual priming in visual word identification.},

abstract = {This paper presents a simple formal-analytical model delivering qualitative predictions for re-sponse times in binary-choice experiments. It combines a dual-process/multi-strategy approach with the standard diffusion model, modeling a utility decision process and a heuristic decision process as diffusion processes of evidence accumulation. For experiments with objective al-ternatives (including many tasks in judgment and decision making), the model predicts that errors will be quicker than correct responses in case of process conflict and slower in case of alignment, capturing a well-documented asymmetry regarding slow or fast errors. Further, the model also predicts that correct responses are slower in case of conflict than in case of align-ment, capturing the well-known Stroop effect. The model is also extended to cover experiments with subjective alternative evaluations, i.e., preferential choice. In this case, results depend on whether trials are hard or easy, i.e., on whether the heuristic can be interpreted as relatively automatic or not. Response times are a central tool for the study of psy-chological processes underlying human decisions. They are especially important in two-alternative choice experiments, which in turn are ubiquitous in several branches of psychol-ogy. Many formal-analytical models have been developed to account for regularities in the data, one of the most prominent thereof being the diffusion model of evidence accumulation (Ratcliff, 1978, 2013; Ratcliff {\&} Rouder, 1998; Smith, 2000).

of the neural representations in the cerebral association cortex.
In inferior temporal cortex, which serves as the storehouse of visual
long-term memory, activation of mnemonic engrams through electric
stimulation results in imagery recall in humans, and neurons can
be dynamically activated by the necessity for memory recall in monkeys.
Neuropsychological studies and previous split-brain experiments predicted
that prefrontal cortex exerts executive control upon inferior temporal
cortex in memory retrieval; however, no neuronal correlate of this
process has ever been detected. Here we show evidence of the top-down
signal from prefrontal cortex. In the absence of bottom-up visual
inputs, single inferior temporal neurons were activated by the top-down
signal, which conveyed information on semantic categorization imposed
by visual stimulus-stimulus association. Behavioural performance
was severely impaired with loss of the top-down signal. Control experiments
confirmed that the signal was transmitted not through a subcortical
but through a fronto-temporal cortical pathway. Thus, feedback projections
from prefrontal cortex to the posterior association cortex appear
to serve the executive control of voluntary recall.},

A self-paced reading experiment and three offline experiments (two acceptability rating studies and a sentence completion study) find evidence that readers immediately try to associate a reflexive pronoun embedded inside a wh-phrase with a potential antecedent in the preceding clause.

Semantic notions of prominence and conceptual interconnection are used to develop a model of CONCEPTUAL REFERENCE POINTS which defines the contexts within which coreference is acceptable or unacceptable. The analysis provides a conceptual-semantic account of the 'core' anaphora facts which have previously been explained in terms of structural notions such as c-command, as well as certain data which have long been problematic for structural accounts.},

abstract = {We propose a mixed-effects vector auto-regressive (ME-VAR) model for studying brain effective connectivity. One common approach to investigating inter-regional associations in brain activity is the multivariate auto-regressive (VAR) model. The standard VAR model unrealistically assumes the connectivity structure to be identical across all participants in a study and therefore, could yield misleading results. The ME-VAR model overcomes this limitation by incorporating a participant-specific connectivity structure. In addition, the ME-VAR models can capture connectivity differences across experimental conditions and patient groups. The ME-VAR model directly decomposes the connectivity matrices into (i.) the condition-specific connectivity matrix, which is shared by all participants in the study (fixed effect) and (ii.) a participant-specific component (random effect) which accounts for between-subject variation in connectivity. An advantage of our approach is that it permits the use of both theoretical results on mixed effects models and existing statistical software when fitting the model. Another advantage of the proposed approach is that it provides improved estimates of the within-subject coefficients (the random effects) by pooling information across subjects in a single-stage rather than the usual two-stage approach. We illustrate the ME-VAR model on a functional MRI data set obtained to investigate brain connectivity in the prefrontal, pre-motor and parietal cortices while humans performed a motor-related, decision-making and action selection task.},

abstract = {What is model selection? What are the goals of model selection? What are the methods of model selection and how do they work? Which methods perform better than others and in what circumstances? These questions rest on a number of key concepts in a relatively underdeveloped field. The aim of this paper is to explain some background concepts, to highlight some of the results in this special issue, and to add my own. The standard methods of model selection include classical hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood, Bayes method, minimum description length, cross-validation, and Akaike's information criterion. They all provide an implementation of Occam's razor, in which parsimony or simplicity is balanced against goodness-of-fit. These methods primarily take account of the sampling errors in parameter estimation, although their relative success at this task depends on the circumstances. However, the aim of model selection should also include the ability of a model to generalize to predictions in a different domain. Errors of extrapolation, or generalization, are different from errors of parameter estimation. So, it seems that simplicity and parsimony may be an additional factor in managing these errors, in which case the standard methods of model selection are incomplete implementations of Occam's razor.

abstract = {Preparing words in speech production is normally a fast and accurate process. We generate them two or three per second in fluent conversation; and overtly naming a clear picture of an object can easily be initiated within 600 msec after picture onset. The underlying process, however, is exceedingly complex. The theory reviewed in this target article analyzes this process as staged and feed-forward. After a first stage of conceptual preparation, word generation proceeds through lexical selection, morphological and phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and articulation itself. In addition, the speaker exerts some degree of output control, by monitoring of self-produced internal and overt speech. The core of the theory, ranging from lexical selection to the initiation of phonetic encoding, is captured in a computational model, called WEAVER++. Both the theory and the computational model have been developed in interaction with reaction time experiments, particularly in picture naming or related word production paradigms, with the aim of accounting for the real-time processing in normal word production. A comprehensive review of theory, model, and experiments is presented. The model can handle some of the main observations in the domain of speech errors (the major empirical domain for most other theories of lexical access), and the theory opens new ways of approaching the cerebral organization of speech production by way of high-temporal-resolution imaging.},

Simplicity is often represented by parameter counts; the fewer the parameters, the simpler the model. Arguments are presented here suggesting that simplicity has little place in discussions of modeling; instead, the concept of flexibility should be substituted. When comparing two models one should be wary of the possibility of their differential flexibility. Several methods for assessing relative flexibility are possible, as represented in this special issue of the Journal of Mathematical Psychology. Here, the method of cross-validation is applied in the comparison of two models, a linear integration model (LIM) and the fuzzy-logical model of perception (FLMP), in the fitting of 44 data sets concerning the perception of layout seen among three panels with the presence or absence of four sources of information for depth. Prior to cross-validation the two models performed about equally well; after cross-validation LIM was statistically superior to FLMP, but the overall pattern of fits remained nearly the same for both models.

abstract = {The hypothesis that pronouns can be resolved via either the syntax or the discourse representation has played an important role in linguistic accounts of pronoun interpretation (e.g. Grodzinsky {\&} Reinhart, 1993). We report the results of an eye-movement monitoring study investigating the relative timing of syntactically-mediated variable binding and discourse-based coreference assignment during pronoun resolution. We examined whether ambiguous pronouns are preferentially resolved via either the variable binding or coreference route, and in particular tested the hypothesis that variable binding should always be computed before coreference assignment. Participants' eye movements were monitored while they read sentences containing a pronoun and two potential antecedents, a c-commanding quantified noun phrase and a non c-commanding proper name. Gender congruence between the pronoun and either of the two potential antecedents was manipulated as an experimental diagnostic for dependency formation. In two experiments, we found that participants' reading times were reliably longer when the linearly closest antecedent mismatched in gender with the pronoun. These findings fail to support the hypothesis that variable binding is computed before coreference assignment, and instead suggest that antecedent recency plays an important role in affecting the extent to which a variable binding antecedent is considered. We discuss these results in relation to models of memory retrieval during sentence comprehension, and interpret the antecedent recency preference as an example of forgetting over time.

In Experiment 1, participants completed subject noun phrase (NP) stimuli consisting of a head NP followed by two prepositional phrase (PP) modifiers, where the first PP modified the first NP, and the second PP modified one of the two preceding NPs. Semantic integration between the head noun and the local noun within each PP was held constant across structures. The mismatch error pattern showed an effect of linear distance to the head noun and no influence of hierarchical distance. In Experiment 2, participants completed NP PP PP stimuli in which both PPs modified the head noun, and both the order of the two PPs and the local nouns' degree of semantic integration with the head noun were varied. The pattern of mismatch errors reflected a combination of semantic integration and linear distance to the head noun. These studies indicate that agreement processes are strongly constrained by grammatical-level scope of planning, with local nouns planned closer to the head having a greater chance of interfering with agreement computation.},

Based on this view, we assume that the language comprehension system by default prefers to achieve as early as possible and remain as long as possible in a state of cognitive equilibrium where linguistic representations are successfully incorporated with existing knowledge structures (i.e., schemata) so that a meaningful and coherent overall representation is formed, and uncertainty is resolved or at least minimized. We also argue that the online equilibrium hypothesis is consistent with current theories of language processing, which maintain that linguistic representations are formed through a complex interplay between simple heuristics and deep syntactic algorithms and also theories that hold that linguistic representations are often incomplete and lacking in detail. We also propose a model of language processing that makes use of both heuristic and algorithmic processing, is sensitive to online cognitive equilibrium, and, we argue, is capable of explaining the formation of underspecified representations. We review previous findings providing evidence for underspecification in relation to this hypothesis and the associated language processing model and argue that most of these findings are compatible with them.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Psychonomic Society, Inc. Although prosody clearly affects the interpretation of utterances, the mapping between prosodic representations and acoustic features is highly variable. Listeners may in part cope with this variability by adapting to distributions of acoustic features in the input. We examined whether listeners adapt to distributional changes using the construction It looks like an X. When pronounced with an H* pitch accent on the final noun and a low boundary tone, the construction supports an affirmative interpretation (e.g., It looks like a ZEBRA [and I think it is one]). Conversely, when pronounced with a L+H* pitch accent and a rising boundary tone, it suggests a negative interpretation (e.g., It LOOKS like a zebra.... [but it is not] ). Experiment 1 elicited pragmatic interpretations of resynthesized 12-step continua with these two contours as the end points. In Experiment 2, one group of listeners heard items sampled from the most ambiguous region along the continua followed by affirmative continuations (e.g., It looks like a zebra because it has stripes all over its body) and items near the contrastive endpoint followed by negative continuations (e.g., It looks like a zebra but it is actually something else). Another group heard the reverse (i.e., ambiguous items with negative continuations and non-contrastive items with affirmative continuations). The two groups of participants subsequently derived diverging interpretations for novel ambiguous items, suggesting that prosodic processing involves flexible mappings between acoustic features and prosodic representations that are meaningful in interpretation of speech.},

We focus on the class of deterministic race models, which assume that the effects of fluctuations in the parameters of the accumulation processes between-choice trials (between-choice noise) dominate the effects of fluctuations occurring while making a choice (within-choice noise) in behavioral data (i.e., response times and choices). The latter deterministic approximation, when combined with the assumption that accumulation is linear, leads to a class of models that can be readily applied to simple-choice behavior because they are computationally tractable. We develop a new and mathematically simple exemplar within the class of linear deterministic models, the Lognormal race (LNR). We then examine how the LNR, and another widely applied linear deterministic model, Brown and Heathcote's (2008) LBA, account for a range of benchmark simple-choice effects in lexical-decision task data reported by Wagenmakers et al. (2008). Our results indicate that the LNR provides an accurate description of this data. Although the LBA model provides a slightly better account, both models support similar psychological conclusions.},

abstract = {Abstract An English double‐embedded relative clause from which the middle verb is omitted can often be processed more easily than its grammatical counterpart, a phenomenon known as the grammaticality illusion. This effect has been found to be reversed in German, suggesting that the illusion is language specific rather than a consequence of universal working memory constraints. We present results from three self‐paced reading experiments which show that Dutch native speakers also do not show the grammaticality illusion in Dutch, whereas both German and Dutch native speakers do show the illusion when reading English sentences. These findings provide evidence against working memory constraints as an explanation for the observed effect in English. We propose an alternative account based on the statistical patterns of the languages involved. In support of this alternative, a single recurrent neural network model that is trained on both Dutch and English sentences is shown to predict the cross‐linguistic difference in the grammaticality effect.

abstract = {It is widely believed that humans are endowed with a specialized numerical process, called subitizing, which enables them to apprehend rapidly and accurately the numerosity of small sets of objects. A major part of the evidence for this process is a purported discontinuity in the mean response time (RT) versus numerosity curves at about 4 elements, when subjects enumerate up to 7 or more elements in a visual display. In this article, RT data collected in a speeded enumeration experiment are subjected to a variety of statistical analyses, including several tests on the RT distributions. None of these tests reveals a significant discontinuity as numerosity increases. The data do suggest a strong stochastic dominance in RT by display numerosity, indicating that the mental effort required to enumerate does increase with each additional element in the display, both within and beyond the putative subitizing range.},

abstract = {How important is the ability to freely control eye movements for reading comprehension? And how does the parser make use of this freedom? We investigated these questions using coregistration of eye movements and event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while participants read either freely or in a computer-controlled word-by-word format (also known as RSVP). Word-by-word presentation and natural reading both elicited qualitatively similar ERP effects in response to syntactic and semantic violations (N400 and P600 effects). Comprehension was better in free reading but only in trials in which the eyes regressed to previous material upon encountering the anomaly. A more fine-grained ERP analysis revealed that these regressions were strongly associated with the well-known P600 effect. In trials without regressions, we instead found sustained centro-parietal negativities starting at around 320 ms post-onset; however, these negativities were only found when the violation occurred in sentence-final position. Taken together, these results suggest that the sentence processing system engages in strategic choices: In response to words that don't match built-up expectations, it can either explore alternative interpretations (reflected by regressions, P600 effects, and good com-prehension) or pursue a " good-enough " processing strategy that tolerates a deficient interpretation (reflected by progressive saccades, sustained negativities, and relatively poor comprehension).},

a relatively stable feature of the parsing routine because it confers
real information processing advantages on the reader or listener.
Experiment 1A showed that Spanish readers apparently do not use the
Late Closure strategy to interpret a particular type of sentence.
With comparable materials, however, English readers do use this strategy
(Experiment 1B). Experiments 2, 3 and 4 showed that the structural
choices were made while the subjects were actually reading the sentence.
The results throw doubt on the suggestion that the Late Closure strategy
is favoured (in English) mainly because it is efficient in information
processing terms. It may be that different languages make use of
parsing strategies in an essentially arbitrary way. Implications
for general theories of human parsing are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper investigates subject-verb agreement in Turkish with particular focus on the role the animacy of plural subjects plays in verbal number marking. Previous descriptive grammars of Turkish (e.g., Sezer, 1978) report an asymmetry in number marking for plural subjects: if the plural subject denotes an animate entity, both plural and singular verbs are possible, whereas only singular verbs are possible when the plural subject denotes an inanimate entity. Using the magnitude estimation method, we measured the well-formedness of simple Turkish sentences consisting of a plural subject and a verb in two groups of participants that differ only in age (mean: 28 years old and 43 years old). The overall results provide an empirical validation of the proposed split between animate and inanimate subjects and suggest that the acceptability of plural agreement is sensitive to even more fine-grained distinctions of animacy. In particular, the plural dispreference was reduced for inanimates with a teleological capacity (in the sense of Folli and Harley, 2008) and for body parts, in comparison to true inanimates (e.g., furniture and clothes). Accordingly, we propose an animacy hierarchy for Turkish that is in line with typological observations (e.g., Corbett, 2000, 2006) and augment it with a further distinction between quasi-animates and inanimates.Although less pronounced in sentences with animate subjects, we observed a higher preference for singular verbs over plural verbs across all conditions. This suggests that the singular marking on the verb, which is zero marked in Turkish, is the default. Furthermore, we find a significant effect of age: in the older group, the singular preference is less pronounced across the conditions and almost absent in sentences with an animate subject. Moreover, the older participants made finer distinctions in the animacy hierarchy, further differentiating between two types of quasi-animates (teleologically capable entities vs. entities with inherited animacy). The two generations in our study share the animate-inanimate split as well as the sharp contrast between singular and plural agreement in sentences with inanimate subjects; they differ, however, in degree of optionality. Altogether, these results suggest a decrease in the degree of optionality across generations. As in research on language attrition and bilingualism (Hulk and M??ller, 2000; M??ller and Hulk, 2001; Sorace, 2011), the results accord with the idea that interface phenomena are vulnerable to change; however, non-convergence between generations in our study stemmed from areas that yield gradient rather than categorical results. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Fedorenko2012,
abstract = {For every claim in the neuroimaging literature about a particular brain region supporting syntactic processing, there exist other claims implicating the target region in different linguistic processes, and, in many cases, in non-linguistic cognitive processes (e.g., Blumstein, 2009). We argue that traditional group analysis methods in neuroimaging may obscure functional specificity because of inter-subject anatomical variability (Fedorenko {\&} Kanwisher, 2009). In Fedorenko, Hsieh, Nieto-Castanon, Whitfield-Gabrieli, and Kanwisher (2010) we presented a functional localizer that allows quick and reliable identification of key language-sensitive regions in each individual brain. This approach enables pooling data from corresponding functional regions across subjects rather than from the same locations in stereotaxic space that may differ functionally due to inter-subject anatomical variability. In the current paper we demonstrate that the individual-subjects functional localization approach is superior to the traditional methods in its ability to distinguish among conditions in a brain region's response. This ability is at the core of all neuroimaging research and is critical for answering questions of functional specialization (e.g., does a brain region specialize for processing syntactic aspects of the linguistic signal), which is in turn essential for making inferences about the precise computations conducted in each brain region. Based on our results, we argue that supplementing existing methods with an individual-subjects functional localization approach may lead to a clearer picture of the neural basis of syntactic processing, as it has in some other domains, such as high-level vision (e.g., Kanwisher, 2010) and social cognition (e.g., Saxe {\&} Kanwisher, 2003). {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc..},

@article{Xu2015,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper explores the relation between familiarity of Chinese subjects and the syntactic distance. We propose two hypotheses: (1) contextually given Mandarin Chinese subjects are more likely to be used with long intervening adverbials than contextually new subjects; and (2) subjects with higher word frequency are more likely to be followed by long adverbials than those with lower word frequency. The data from two Mandarin Chinese treebanks provide supportive evidence for the first hypothesis, but not the second. Cognitively, this is probably due to the possibility that contextual givenness, which reflects familiarity, may lessen the effect of locality by increasing the activation level (the accessibility) of the subject and rendering these subjects less susceptible to the memory decay caused by the adverbials intervening between them and the predicate verbs. Subjects are usually the starting point of a sentence, which has a default given–new information structure. Therefore, when organizing a sentence, we are dominantly concerned with the information status (contextual givenness) relative to previous context when choosing the subjects, which may partly accounts for the observed irrelevance between word frequency and the use of adverbials. A sentence is structured based on the information status of the subjects, not their word frequency.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {It is well known that sentences containing object-extracted relative clauses (e.g., The reporter that the senator attacked admitted the error) are more difficult to comprehend than sentences containing subject-extracted relative clauses (e.g., The reporter that attacked the senator admitted the error). Two major accounts of this phenomenon make different predictions about where, in the course of incremental processing of an object relative, difficulty should first appear. An account emphasizing memory processes (Gibson, 1998; Grodner {\&} Gibson, 2005) predicts difficulty at the relative clause verb, while an account emphasizing experience-based expectations (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) predicts earlier difficulty, at the relative clause subject. Two eye movement experiments tested these predictions. Regressive saccades were much more likely from the subject noun phrase of an object relative than from the same noun phrase occurring within a subject relative (Experiment 1) or within a verbal complement clause (Experiment 2). This effect was further amplified when the relative pronoun that was omitted. However, reading time was also inflated on the object relative clause verb in both experiments. These results suggest that the violation of expectations and the difficulty of memory retrieval both contribute to the difficulty of object relative clauses, but that these two sources of difficulty have qualitatively distinct behavioral consequences in normal reading. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Filler-gap domains are complex in proportion to their size and in proportion to the amount of simultaneous syntactic and semantic processing that is required in addition to gap identification. They are simplified by making the gap easier to identify and process, or by avoiding a gap structure altogether. When grammatical variation is viewed from this perspective many descriptive insights and implicational patterns can be motivated that have either been stipulated or that have gone unnoticed hitherto.

Other limitations associated with task preparation, sensory-perceptual processes, and timing can generate additional and distinct forms of interference. These conclusions challenge widely accepted ideas about attentional resources and probe reaction time methodologies.

abstract = {An important dimension of cognitive control is the adaptive regulation
of the balancebetween exploitation (pursuing known sources of reward)
and exploration (seeking new ones) inresponse to changes in task
utility. Recent studies suggest that the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine(LC-NE)
system may play an important role in this function, and that pupil
diameter can be used toindex LC activity. Based on this, we reasoned
that pupil diameter may correlate closely with controlstate and associated
changes in behavior. Specifically, we predicted that increases in
baseline pupildiameter would be associated with decreases in task
utility and disengagement from the task(exploration), while reduced
baseline diameter (but increases in task-evoked dilations) would
beassociated with task engagement (exploitation). Findings in three
experiments were consistent withthese predictions, suggesting that
pupillometry may be useful both as an index of control state and,indirectly,
of LC function.},

We show that for Posner cuing with saccadic responses, microsaccades go with attention in at least 75{\%} of cases (almost 90{\%} if probability matching is assumed) when they are first (or only) microsaccades in the cue--target interval and when they occur between 200 and 400 msec after the cue. The relation between spatial attention and the direction of microsaccades drops to chance level for unselected microsaccades collected during manual-response conditions. Analyses of data from four cross-modal cuing experiments demonstrate an above-chance, intermediate link for visual cues, but no systematic relation for auditory cues. Thus, the link between spatial attention and direction of microsaccades depends on the experimental condition and time of occurrence, but it can be very strong.},

Here we explore the discourse condition that favors antecedents that are part of the main assertion of an utterance. We argue that the main assertion tendency is best captured in the processor, not the grammar. Two experiments test verb phrase ellipsis examples with antecedents in a conditional. One suggests that, because of the main assertion tendency, a reader considers full conditional antecedents and not just verb phrase antecedents. However, when the antecedent of the conditional expresses already given information and essentially becomes redundant, fewer full conditional antecedents are chosen for the verb phrase ellipsis, as if the consequent clause has become the assertion of the conditional sentence with the if-clause essentially cancelling out. The second experiment explores examples where a modal is added inside the if-clause, rendering the conditional counterfactual. As in other examples of flawed or imperfect ellipsis, the non-actuality entailment/implicature improves the acceptability of such examples.},

The data confirm that, in early phases of processing, attachment preferences are driven by a locality principle such as Late Closure. Based on a review of studies on Portuguese, Spanish and other Romance languages, we argue that the high- versus low-attachment difference across languages emerges cleanly only in off-line tasks, such as questionnaire studies, thus limiting the types of explanations for the crosslinguistic differences. We also advance an explanation for the high attachment preferences found in unspeeded questionnaire studies based on the Implicit Prosody Hypothesis (Fodor, 1998a, 2002).},

abstract = {Some people are better readers than others, and this variation in comprehension ability is predicted by measures of working memory capacity (WMC). The primary goal of this study was to investigate the mediating role of mind wandering experiences in the association between WMC and normal individual differences in reading comprehension, as predicted by the executive- attention theory of WMC (e.g., Engle {\&} Kane, 2004). We used a latent-variable, structural- equation-model approach, testing skilled adult readers on three WMC span tasks, seven varied reading comprehension tasks, and three attention-control tasks. Mind wandering was assessed using experimenter-scheduled thought probes during four different tasks (two reading, two attention-control tasks). The results support the executive-attention theory of WMC. Mind wandering across the four tasks loaded onto a single latent factor, reflecting a stable individual difference. Most importantly, mind wandering was a significant mediator in the relationship between WMC and reading comprehension, suggesting that the WMC-comprehension correlation is driven, in part, by attention control over intruding thoughts. We discuss implications for theories of WMC, attention control, and reading comprehension. Keywords},

abstract = {The development of cognitive models involves the creative scientific formalization of assumptions, based on theory, observation, and other relevant information. In the Bayesian approach to implementing, testing, and using cognitive models, assumptions can influence both the likelihood function of the model, usually corresponding to assumptions about psychological processes, and the prior distribution over model parameters, usually corresponding to assumptions about the psychological variables that influence those processes. The specification of the prior is unique to the Bayesian context, but often raises concerns that lead to the use of vague or non-informative priors in cognitive modeling. Sometimes the concerns stem from philosophical objections, but more often practical difficulties with how priors should be determined are the stumbling block. We survey several sources of information that can help to specify priors for cognitive models, discuss some of the methods by which this information can be formalized in a prior distribution, and identify a number of benefits of including informative priors in cognitive modeling. Our discussion is based on three illustrative cognitive models, involving memory retention, categorization, and decision making.},

abstract = {Wh-dependencies are known to be formed rapidly in real-time$\backslash$ncomprehension. The parser posits the location of gap sites in advance of$\backslash$nthe bottom-up evidence for missing Constituents, and Must therefore have$\backslash$na means of deciding when and where to project dependencies. Previous$\backslash$nstudies have observed that the parser avoids building ungrammatical$\backslash$nwh-dependencies, for example, by restricting the search for gap sites$\backslash$nfrom island domains. This paper tests the stronger claim that$\backslash$nconstraints are not merely respected, but that grammatical knowledge$\backslash$nactively prompts the construction of some representations in advance of$\backslash$nthe input.

abstract = {People can intuitively detect whether a word triad has a common remote associate (coherent) or does not have one (incoherent) before and independently of actually retrieving the common associate. The authors argue that semantic coherence increases the processing fluency for coherent triads and that this increased fluency triggers a brief and subtle positive affect, which is the experiential basis of these intuitions. In a series of 11 experiments with 3 different fluency manipulations (figure-ground contrast, repeated exposure, and subliminal visual priming) and 3 different affect inductions (short-timed facial feedback, subliminal facial priming, and affect-laden word triads), high fluency and positive affect independently and additively increased the probability that triads would be judged as coherent, irrespective of actual coherence. The authors could equalize and even reverse coherence judgments (i.e., incoherent triads were judged to be coherent more frequently than were coherent triads). When explicitly instructed, participants were unable to correct their judgments for the influence of affect, although they were aware of the manipulation. The impact of fluency and affect was also generalized to intuitions of visual coherence and intuitions of grammaticality in an artificial grammar learning paradigm.

abstract = {The functional dissociation of human extrastriate cortical processing
streams for the perception of face identity and location was investigated
in healthy men by measuring visual task-related changes in regional
cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with positron emission tomography (PET)
and H2(15)O. Separate scans were obtained while subjects performed
face matching, location matching, or sensorimotor control tasks.
The matching tasks used identical stimuli for some scans and stimuli
of equivalent visual complexity for others. Face matching was associated
with selective rCBF increases in the fusiform gyrus in occipital
and occipitotemporal cortex bilaterally and in a right prefrontal
area in the inferior frontal gyrus. Location matching was associated
with selective rCBF increases in dorsal occipital, superior parietal,
and intraparietal sulcus cortex bilaterally and in dorsal right premotor
cortex. Decreases in rCBF, relative to the sensorimotor control task,
were observed for both matching tasks in auditory, auditory association,
somatosensory, and midcingulate cortex. These results suggest that,
within a sensory modality, selective attention is associated with
increased activity in those cortical areas that process the attended
information but is not associated with decreased activity in areas
that process unattended visual information. Selective attention to
one sensory modality, on the other hand, is associated with decreased
activity in cortical areas dedicated to processing input from other
sensory modalities. Direct comparison of our results with those from
other PET-rCBF studies of extrastriate cortex demonstrates agreement
in the localization of cortical areas mediating face and location
perception and dissociations between these areas and those mediating
the perception of color and motion.},

This model allows us to compute the posterior estimates of the response time distribution hazard function and the systems factorial technology functionals that can be computed from it, including the survivor function interaction contrast and the capacity coefficient. We then compute posterior estimates of statistics that reflect different behaviors of the functionals, and so arrive at a fully Bayesian and theoretically-motivated approach to systems factorial technology.

Research has shown that readers selectively activate and remember relevant information associated with words in different contexts, but it is not known when in processing this selection occurs. This experiment investigated whether context can change which properties are initially retrieved, using a speed-accuracy trade-off paradigm. Readers had to verify a property of a modifier-noun phrase (e.g., in the sentence Boiled celery is soft) within a specified interval, from 300-3,000 msec after presentation. Results revealed that properties associated with the noun alone were activated sooner than were properties that required integration of the modifier with the noun. Thus, context did not serve to influence the initial retrieval of properties but only to activate or suppress properties later in processing.},

abstract = {Researchers in linguistics and related fields have recently begun exploiting online crowd-sourcing tools, like Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), to gather behavioral data. While this method has been successfully validated for various offline measures--grammaticality judgment or other forced-choice tasks--its use for mainstream psycholinguistic research remains limited. This is because psycholinguistic effects are often dependent on relatively small differences in response times, and there remains some doubt as to whether precise timing measurements can be gathered over the web. Here we show that three classic psycholinguistic effects can in fact be replicated using AMT in combination with open-source software for gathering response times client-side. Specifically, we find reliable effects of subject definiteness, filler-gap dependency processing, and agreement attraction in self-paced reading tasks using approximately the same numbers of participants and/or trials as similar laboratory studies. Our results suggest that psycholinguists can and should be taking advantage of AMT and similar online crowd-sourcing marketplaces as a fast, low-resource alternative to traditional laboratory research.},

abstract = {Abstract Syntactic priming occurs when processing of a target sentence is facilitated following processing of a prime sentence that has the same syntactic structure (Bock, 1986 Cognitive Psychology, 18. 355–387). Syntactic priming has been widely investigated in production (Bock, 1986 Cognitive Psychology, 18. 355–387; Bock and Griffin, 2000 General. 129(2). 177–192; Cleland and Pickering, 2003. Journal of Memory and Language, 49. 214–230; Cleland and Pickering 2006. Journal of Memory and Language, 54. 185–198; Pickering and Branigan, 1998. Journal of Memory and Language, 39. 633–651; and others), but only relatively recently in comprehension (Arai et al. 2007. Cognitive Psychology, 54(3). 218–250; Ledoux et al., 2007. Psychological Science. 18(2). 135–143; and others). This article reviews the current literature on syntactic priming in comprehension and contrasts these findings to those in production. Critically, syntactic priming effects in comprehension are observed more often when prime and target sentences share a content word, whereas in production, these effects are often observed when there are no shared content words between the primes and targets. Possible explanations for the differing degrees of lexical dependency between syntactic priming effects in production and in comprehension are posed and include differences in task paradigms and stimuli, differences in time course and syntactic processing between the two modalities, and mechanistic differences. Implications from the reviewed literature are then considered in attempts at determining the most likely mechanistic explanation for syntactic priming effects in both comprehension and production. A residual activation account (Pickering and Branigan, 1998. Journal of Memory and Language, 39. 633–651), an implicit learning account (Bock and Griffin, 2000 General. 129(2). 177–192; Chang et al. 2006. Psychological Review, 113(2). 234–272), and a dual mechanism account (Tooley, 2009. Is Syntactic Priming in Sentence Comprehension Really Just Implicit Learning? Paper presented to the 22nd Annual CUNY Conference on Human Sentence Processing, Davis, March 26–28) are outlined. The dual mechanism account may prove more consistent with a wider range of the reviewed research findings.},

However, there is little systematic guidance associated with these
methods for solving important practical questions that arise in cluster
analysis, such as how many clusters are there, which clustering method
should be used, and how should outliers be handled. We review a general
methodology for model-based clustering that provides a principled
statistical approach to these issues. We also show that this can
be useful for other problems in multivariate analysis, such as discriminant
analysis and multivariate density estimation. We give examples from
medical diagnosis, mine eld detection, cluster recovery from noisy

of the methodology and discuss recent developments in model-based

(2015), A " bag-of-arguments " mechanism for initial verb predictions, we investigated the predictions that comprehenders initially make about an upcoming verb as they read and provided evidence that they are sensitive to the arguments' lexical meaning but not their structural roles. Here we synthesise findings from our work with other studies that show that verb predictions are sensitive to the arguments' roles if more time is available for prediction. We content that prediction involves computations that may require differing amounts of time. Further, we argue that prediction can be usefully framed as a memory retrieval problem, linking prediction to independently well-understood memory mechanisms in language processing. We suggest that the delayed impact of argument roles on verb predictions may reflect a mismatch between the format of linguistic cues and target event memories. We clarify points of agreement and disagreement with the commentaries, and explain why memory access mechanisms can account for the time course of prediction. ARTICLE HISTORY},

@article{Walker1940a,
abstract = {A concept of central importance to modern statistical theory which few textbooks have attempted to clarify is that of "degrees of freedom." For the mathematician who reads the original papers in which statistical theory is now making such rapid advances, the concept is a familiar one needing no particular explanation. For the person who is unfamiliar with N-dimensional geometry or who knows the contributions to modern sampling theory only from secondhand sources such as textbooks, this concept often seems almost mystical, with no practical meaning. Tippett, one of the few textbook writers who attempt to make any general explanation of the concept, begins his account (p. 64) with the sentence, "This conception of degrees of freedom is not altogether easy to attain, and we cannot attempt a full justification of it here; but we shall show its reasonableness and shall illustrate it, hoping that as a result of familiarity with its use the reader will appreciate it." Not only do most texts omit all mention of the concept but many actually give incorrect formulas and procedures because of ignoring it. In the work of modern statisticians, the concept of degrees of freedom is not found before "Student's" paper of 1908, it was first made explicit by the writings of R. A. Fisher, beginning with his paper of 1915 on the distribution of the correlation coefficient, and has only within the decade or so received general recognition. Nevertheless the concept was familiar to Gauss and his astronomical associates. In his classical work on the Theory of the Combination of Observations (Theoria Combinationis Observationum Erroribus Minimis Obnoxiae) and also in a work generalizing the theory of least squares with reference to the combination of observations (Erg{\"{a}}nzung zur Theorie der den kleinsten Fehlern unterworfen Combination der Beobachtungen, 1826), he states both in words and by formula that the number of observations is to be decreased by the number of unknowns estimated from the data to serve as divisor in estimating the standard error},

abstract = {Two self-paced reading experiments using a paraphrase decision task paradigm were performed to investigate how sentence complexity contributed to the relative clause (RC) attachment preferences of speakers of different working memory capacities (WMCs). Experiment 1 (English) showed working memory effects on relative clause processing in both offline RC attachment preferences and in online reading time measures, but no effects of syntactic complexity. In Experiment 2 (Korean), syntactic complexity due to greater distance between integrating heads, as measured by the dependency locality theory (Gibson in Cognition 68:1-76, 1998), significantly increased the proportion of attachment to NP1. However, no effects of working memory were found. The difference in results between English and Korean is proposed to be due to head-directionality effects. The results of our study support the conclusion that working memory-based accounts provide a better explanation than previous language-dependent accounts for differences in RC attachment preferences. We propose that previous language dependent-accounts of cross-linguistic differences in RC processing have overlooked the interaction between individual WMC and a language's general structure, which is a central factor in RC attachment.},

abstract = {Nonlinear regression models are applied in a broad variety of scientific fields. Various R functions are already dedicated to fitting such models, among which the function nls() has a prominent position. Unlike linear regression fitting of nonlinear models relies on non-trivial assumptions and therefore users are required to carefully ensure and validate the entire modeling. Parameter estimation is carried out using some variant of the least- squares criterion involving an iterative process that ideally leads to the determination of the optimal parameter estimates. Therefore, users need to have a clear understanding of the model and its parameterization in the context of the application and data consid- ered, an a priori idea about plausible values for parameter estimates, knowledge of model diagnostics procedures available for checking crucial assumptions, and, finally, an under- standing of the limitations in the validity of the underlying hypotheses of the fitted model and its implication for the precision of parameter estimates. Current nonlinear regression modules lack dedicated diagnostic functionality. So there is a need to provide users with an extended toolbox of functions enabling a careful evaluation of nonlinear regression fits. To this end, we introduce a unified diagnostic framework with the R package nlstools. In this paper, the various features of the package are presented and exemplified using a worked example from pulmonary medicine.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of comparing complex hierarchical models in which the number of parameters is not clearly defined. Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure PD for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general PD approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding PD to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

Word recognition processes seem to be reflected quite straightforwardly in the eye movement record. In contrast, eye movements seem to reflect sentence comprehension processes in a more varied fashion. This chapter reviews the major word identification factors that affect eye movements and describe the role these eye movement phenomena have played in developing theories of eye movements in reading. The chapter tabulates and summarizes 100 reports of how syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and world-knowledge factors affect eye movements during reading in an initial attempt to identify order in how different types of challenges to comprehension are reflected in eye movements.

abstract = {We assess the amount of shared variance between three measures of visual word recognition latencies: eye movement latencies, lexical decision times, and naming times. After partialling out the effects of word frequency and word length, two well-documented predictors of word recognition latencies, we see that 7-44{\%} of the variance is uniquely shared between lexical decision times and naming times, depending on the frequency range of the words used. A similar analysis of eye movement latencies shows that the percentage of variance they uniquely share either with lexical decision times or with naming times is much lower. It is 5-17{\%} for gaze durations and lexical decision times in studies with target words presented in neutral sentences, but drops to 0.2{\%} for corpus studies in which eye movements to all words are analysed. Correlations between gaze durations and naming latencies are lower still. These findings suggest that processing times in isolated word processing and continuous text reading are affected by specific task demands and presentation format, and that lexical decision times and naming times are not very informative in predicting eye movement latencies in text reading once the effect of word frequency and word length are taken into account. The difference between controlled experiments and natural reading suggests that reading strategies and stimulus materials may determine the degree to which the immediacy-of-processing assumption and the eye-mind assumption apply. Fixation times are more likely to exclusively reflect the lexical processing of the currently fixated word in controlled studies with unpredictable target words rather than in natural reading of sentences or texts.},

Pickering, 2001) have explored the question of whether the parser initially analyzes a noun phrase that follows an intransitive verb as the verb's direct object. Three eye-tracking experiments examined this issue in more detail. Experiment 1 replicated the finding that readers experience difficulty on this noun phrase in normal reading and found that this difficulty occurs even with intransitive verbs for which a direct object is categorically prohibited. Experiment 2, however, demonstrated that this effect is not due to syntactic misanalysis but to disruption that occurs when a comma is absent at a subordinate clause/main clause boundary. Experiment 3 replicated the finding (M. J. Pickering {\&} M. J. Traxler, 2003; M. J. Traxler {\&} M. J. Pickering, 1996) that when a noun phrase "filler" is an implausible direct object for an optionally transitive relative clause verb, processing difficulty results; however, there was no evidence for such difficulty when the relative clause verb was strictly intransitive. Taken together, the 3 experiments undermine the support for the claim that the parser initially ignores a verb's subcategorization restrictions.},

abstract = {Mixed-effects models are being used ever more frequently in the analysis of experimental data. However, in the lme4 package in R the standards for evaluating significance of fixed effects in these models (i.e., obtaining p-values) are somewhat vague. There are good reasons for this, but as researchers who are using these models are required in many cases to report p-values, some method for evaluating the significance of the model output is needed. This paper reports the results of simulations showing that the two most common methods for evaluating significance, using likelihood ratio tests and applying the z distribution to the Wald t values from the model output (t-as-z), are somewhat anti-conservative, especially for smaller sample sizes. Other methods for evaluating significance, including parametric bootstrapping and the Kenward-Roger and Satterthwaite approximations for degrees of freedom, were also evaluated. The results of these simulations suggest that Type 1 error rates are closest to .05 when models are fitted using REML and p-values are derived using the Kenward-Roger or Satterthwaite approximations, as these approximations both produced acceptable Type 1 error rates even for smaller samples.},

@article{Aoshima2002,
abstract = {This paper presents evidence for the Active Filler Effect (Frazier {\&} Clifton 1989) in Japanese. The experimental results show that Japanese speakers preferentially associate a fronted wh-phrase with the first potential scope marker, even when that is contained in an embedded clause. This finding allows us to propose two refinements to the Active Filler Strategy's operation for all languages. We suggest that (i) the Active Filler Strategy results from the parser's rapid attempt to associate an operator with a q-marked variable position, and that (ii) the parser is able to rescind existing commitments in order to satisfy other constraints. Results from a self-paced reading experiment indicate that a fronted w h-phrase is associated with the embedded verb, an association which we argue suggests reanalysis from an initial matrix clause association. Introduction The main objective of this paper is to examine the cross-linguistic operation of the Active Filler Strategy first proposed for English by Frazier and Clifton (1989). Many studies have argued that the processing of wh-phrases initiates a search for a gap, which is posited at the earliest point allowed by the grammar. This tendency has become known as "The Active Filler Strategy" (henceforth the AFS). Since the AFS is a descriptive statement, we should try to uncover the underlying factors responsible for this generalization. We suggest that wh-scope licensing and argument saturation are crucial to an understanding of apparent cross-linguistic variation in Active Filler effects. Based on our experimental results, we find that Japanese readers prefer to associate a fronted wh-phrase with an embedded clause. We propose that the reason for the interpretation of the wh-phrase in the embedded clause is that active gap filling is driven by other grammatical requirements, specifically wh-scope licensing and argument saturation. This, in turn, has implications for theories of reanalysis. In order to associate the wh-filler with an embedded clause gap-site, readers must revise their initial matrix question interpretation of the sentence. This forces us to revise claims that reanalysis is always a last-resort operation. We re-interpret the availability of unforced reanalysis in terms of grammatical constraints as well.},

However, it is unclear whether and how expectations and memory interact. We first confirm a key prediction of the expectation account: a Hindi self-paced reading study shows that when an expectation for an upcoming part of speech is dashed, building a rarer structure consumes more processing time than building a less rare structure. This is a strong validation of the expectation-based account. In a second study, we show that when expectation is strong, i.e., when a particular verb is predicted, strong facilitation effects are seen when the appearance of the verb is delayed; however, when expectation is weak, i.e., when only the part of speech "verb" is predicted but a particular verb is not predicted, the facilitation disappears and a tendency towards a locality effect is seen. The interaction seen between expectation strength and distance shows that strong expectations cancel locality effects, and that weak expectations allow locality effects to emerge.},

This neurocognitive approach attempts to integrate the distributed feature-based characteristics of the CSA with a distributed and feature-based model of sensory object processing. Based on a review of relevant functional imaging and neuropsychological data, we argue that distributed accounts of feature-based representations have considerable explanatory power, and that a cognitive model of conceptual representations is needed to understand their neural bases.},

Detailed code for all analyses is described using packages for the freeware R.},

@article{Gilboy1995,
abstract = {Three questionnaire studies investigated Spanish and English readers' interpretations of sentences with complex noun phrases (NPs) such as "I really liked the preface of the bookk that I read yesterday.". These complex NPs are ambigous between two readings, one in which the relative clause (RC) that I read yesterday modifies the first noun, N1, preface, or the second noun. N2, book. Cuetos and Mitchell (Cognition, 1988, 30, 73-105) claimed that Spanish was biased toward having the RC modify N1, which they claimed was evidence against the cross-language universality of the late closure parsing principle. We demonstrate that the preference for N1 versus N2 modification varies greatly between different contruction types within both Spanish and English while the variation between languages is relatively minor, but still of interest. The effect cannot be reduced to an effect of plausibility, but seems to reflect directly certain syntactic and semantic aspects of the constructions studied. We claim that relative clauses and other "nonprimary" phrases are not parsed following such parsing principles as late closure, but instead follow principles we advanced in the form of the construal hypothesis. Thus, it is not the case that late closure is a language-specific strategy; rather, it and similar sstuctural parsing principles are specific to only certain classes of phrases within a language. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Recent research has shown much evidence that sentence comprehension can be extremely predictive. However, we currently know little about the limits of predictive processing. In the two eye-tracking experiments, we examined whether predictive information in dependency formation is inevitably given priority over a well-known structural preference in syntactic ambiguity resolution. Experiment 1 used sentences including control nouns like order (e.g. After Andrew's order to wash the kids came over to the house). If predictive dependency information is given priority over disambiguation preferences, then readers could immediately interpret the kids as the ones who have been ordered to wash, thus avoiding the garden path at the main verb came. However, garden path effects were found irrespective of control information, although the garden path difficulty was reduced when the lexical control information highlighted the globally correct analysis (as in the above example), relative to when it did not. Experiment 2 replicated these results with adjunct control, where the relevant dependency is obligatory (e.g. After refusing to wash the kids came over to the house). Again, control information did not influence initial disambiguation, but did affect the difficulty of garden path recovery. Overall, the results suggest that there are limitations on the influence of predictive dependency formation on on-line structural disambiguation. ?? 2014.},

abstract = {9 Some researchers informally assume that, when they carry out a null hypothesis significance test, a statistically significant result lowers the probability of the null hypothesis being true. Although technically wrong (the null hypothesis does not have a probability associated with it), it is possible under certain assumptions to compute the posterior probability of the null hypothesis being true. We show that this intuitively appealing belief, that the probability of the null being true falls after a significant effect, is in general incorrect and only holds when statistical power is high and when, as suggested by Benjamin et al., 2018, a type I error level is defined that is lower than the conventional one (e.g., $\alpha$ = 0.005). We provide a Shiny app (https://danielschad.shinyapps.io/probnull/) that allows the reader to visualize the different possible scenarios. Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), as it is practised in all areas of science, 11 involves a fairly straightforward procedure. We begin by positing a null hypothesis H 0 , 12 usually a point null hypothesis that a parameter µ has a specific value: H 0 : µ = µ 0. Then 13 we collect data, compute the sample mean ¯ x, and estimate the standard error SE from 14 the sample standard deviation s and sample size n by computing SE = s/ √ n. Next, we 15 compute some statistic such as the observed t-statistic, t observed = ¯ x−µ 0 SE. If the absolute 16 value of the observed t-statistic is larger than the absolute value of some critical t-value, we 17 reject the null hypothesis. Usually we also compute the p-value, which is the probability of 18 obtaining the observed t-statistic, or a value more extreme, assuming that the null hypothe-19 sis is true. Conventionally, when the p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. 20 A common phrasing is to say that we have a "statistically significant" result, and that the 21 Please send correspondence to {\{}schad,vasishth{\}}@uni-potsdam.de.},

The current paper reports two studies, in which speed-accuracy tradeoff and eye-tracking methodologies were used with the same materials to provide converging evidence for the role of syntactic and semantic cues as mediators of both proactive (PI) and retroactive interference (RI) during comprehension. Consistent with previous work (e.g., Van Dyke {\&} Lewis, 2003), we found that syntactic constraints at the retrieval site are among the cues that drive retrieval in comprehension, and that these constraints effectively limit interference from potential distractors with semantic/pragmatic properties in common with the target constituent. The data are discussed in terms of a cue-overload account, in which interference both arises from and is mediated through a direct-access retrieval mechanism that utilizes a linear, weighted cue-combinatoric scheme. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Distributional models represent a word through the contexts in which it has been observed. They can be used to predict similarity in meaning, based on the distributional hypothesis, which states that two words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings. Distributional approaches are often implemented in vector space models. They represent a word as a point in high-dimensional space, where each dimension stands for a context item, and a word's coordinates represent its context counts. Occurrence in similar contexts then means proximity in space. In this survey we look at the use of vector space models to describe the meaning of words and phrases: the phenomena that vector space models address, and the techniques that they use to do so. Many word meaning phenomena can be described in terms of semantic similarity: synonymy, priming, categorization, and the typical-ity of a predicate's arguments. But vector space models can do more than just predict semantic simi-larity. They are a very flexible tool, because they can make use of all of linear algebra, with all its data structures and operations. The dimensions of a vector space can stand for many things: context words, or non-linguistic context like images, or properties of a concept. And vector space models can use matrices or higher-order arrays instead of vectors for representing more complex relation-ships. Polysemy is a tough problem for distributional approaches, as a representation that is learned from all of a word's contexts will conflate the different senses of the word. It can be addressed, using either clustering or vector combination techniques. Finally, we look at vector space models for phrases, which are usually constructed by combining word vectors. Vector space models for phrases can predict phrase similarity, and some argue that they can form the basis for a general-purpose repre-sentation framework for natural language semantics.},

abstract = {The present study investigated the relationship between the location and skew of an individual reader's fixation duration distribution.

The $\tau$ parameter was entirely uncorrelated with the $\mu$ and $\sigma$ parameters; by contrast, there was a modest positive correlation between these parameters for lexical decision and speeded pronunciation response times. The conclusion that, for fixation durations, the degree of skew is uncorrelated with the location of the distribution's central tendency was also confirmed nonparametrically, by examining vincentile plots for subgroups of subjects. Finally, the stability of distributional parameters for a given subject was demonstrated to be relatively high. Taken together with previous findings of selective influence on the $\mu$ parameter of the fixation duration distribution, the present results suggest that in reading, the location and the skew of the fixation duration distribution may reflect functionally distinct processes. The authors speculate that the skew parameter may specifically reflect the frequency of processing disruption.},

abstract = {We present a computational evaluation of three hypotheses about sources of deficit in sentence comprehension in aphasia: slowed processing, intermittent deficiency, and resource reduction. The ACT‐R based Lewis and Vasishth (2005) model is used to implement these three proposals. Slowed processing is implemented as slowed execution time of parse steps; intermittent deficiency as increased random noise in activation of elements in memory; and resource reduction as reduced spreading activation. As data, we considered subject vs. object relative sentences, presented in a self‐paced listening modality to 56 individuals with aphasia (IWA) and 46 matched controls. The participants heard the sentences and carried out a picture verification task to decide on an interpretation of the sentence. These response accuracies are used to identify the best parameters (for each participant) that correspond to the three hypotheses mentioned above. We show that controls have more tightly clustered (less variable) parameter values than IWA; specifically, compared to controls, among IWA there are more individuals with slow parsing times, high noise, and low spreading activation. We find that (a) individual IWA show differential amounts of deficit along the three dimensions of slowed processing, intermittent deficiency, and resource reduction, (b) overall, there is evidence for all three sources of deficit playing a role, and (c) IWA have a more variable range of parameter values than controls. An important implication is that it may be meaningless to talk about sources of deficit with respect to an abstract verage IWA; the focus should be on the individual's differential degrees of deficit along different dimensions, and on understanding the causes of variability in deficit between participants.

abstract = {When confronted with a previously encountered scene, what information is used to guide search to a known target? We contrasted the role of a scene's basic-level category membership with its specific arrangement of visual properties. Observers were repeatedly shown photographs of scenes that contained consistently but arbitrarily located targets, allowing target positions to be associated with scene content. Learned scenes were then unexpectedly mirror reversed, spatially translating visual features as well as the target across the display while preserving the scene's identity and concept. Mirror reversals produced a cost as the eyes initially moved toward the position in the display in which the target had previously appeared. The cost was not complete, however; when initial search failed, the eyes were quickly directed to the target's new position. These results suggest that in real-world scenes, shifts of attention are initially based on scene identity, and subsequent shifts are guided by more detailed information regarding scene and object layout.},

abstract = {
This chapter develops a theory of reanalysis called limited repair parsing.
Repair parsers deal with the problem of local ambiguity in part by modifying
previously built structure when the chosen structure later prove s to be
inconsistent. This modification of existing structure distinguishes repair
parsing from parallel or multi-path parsing, least-commitment parsing,
backtracking, or reparsing strategies. Parsers with a limited capability for
repair are psycholinguistically important because they can potentially
explain the contrasts between difficult garden path structures (when repair
fails) and unproblematic local ambiguities (when repair is successful or
easy). Although the idea of repair has been implicit in some psycholinguistic
work (and emerged explicitly in the diagnosis model of Fodor {\&} Inoue, 1994, and
the NL-Soar model of Lewis, 1993), there has been no clear formulation of the
general class of repair parsers. This chapter makes a first step toward such a
formulation, shows how repair parsing offers significant computational
advantages over other alternatives for reanalysis, and proposes a particular
repair mechanism, snip , that explains a wide range of cross-linguistic
reanalysis phenomena. Snip is a proposal for a simple, automatic, on-line
repair process. The chapter concludes by briefly describing how snip can be
embedded in a more comprehensive sentence processing architecture that maintains
the structural sensitivity of purely syntactic theories like Pritchett's (1992),
yet still accounts for the flexibility of parsing as revealed by interactive
studies},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Johns, Matsuki and Van Dyke. A substantial body of evidence points to a cue-based direct-access retrieval mechanism as a crucial component of skilled adult reading. We report two experiments aimed at examining whether poor readers are able to make use of the same retrieval mechanism. This is significant in light of findings that poor readers have difficulty retrieving linguistic information (e.g., Perfetti, 1985). Our experiments are based on a previous demonstration of direct-access retrieval in language processing, presented in McElree et al. (2003). Experiment 1 replicates the original result using an auditory implementation of the Speed-Accuracy Tradeoff (SAT) method. This finding represents a significant methodological advance, as it opens up the possibility of exploring retrieval speeds in non-reading populations. Experiment 2 provides evidence that poor readers do use a direct-access retrieval mechanism during listening comprehension, despite overall poorer accuracy and slower retrieval speeds relative to skilled readers. The findings are discussed with respect to hypotheses about the source of poor reading comprehension.},

abstract = {A fundamental question in psycholinguistic research concerns the universality of comprehension strategies. We investigated this issue by examining the so-called "subject preference" in Turkish, a language which allows for a natural (unmarked) object reading of an initial ambiguous argument. Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), we observed increased processing difficulty in the form of a broadly distributed positivity when an initial ambiguous argument was disambiguated towards an object reading. This effect was independent of the animacy (i.e. semantic subject prototypicality) of the ambiguous argument. Our results therefore speak in favour of a universal tendency to interpret the first argument encountered as the "subject" of the clause, even in languages providing no obvious structural motivation for such a strategy. However, we argue that the underlying explanation for this preference must be modified in accordance with cross-linguistic considerations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The resulting two-faceted structure parallels the structure of intellectual abilities in the Berlin Intelligence Structure Model (BIS) [Diagnostica 28 (1982) 195.]. A battery of 17 working-memory tasks, chosen to represent the proposed facet structure of working memory, was administered together with a test for the BIS to 128 young adults. General working-memory capacity was highly related to general intelligence. The prediction of intellectual abilities by working-memory capacity was also tested by differentiating predictor and criterion according to the functional and to the content facet. Moreover, the paths from working memory to intelligence factors appear to be highly specific. This suggests that specific working-memory resources, as opposed to a general capacity, are the limiting factors for their corresponding counterparts in the structure of mental abilities. D},

abstract = {Constructing efficient iterative simulation algorithms can be difficult, but inference and monitoring convergence are relatively easy. We first give our recommended strategy (following Section 11.10 of Gelman et al., 2003) and then explain the reasons for our rec- ommendations, illustrating with a relatively simple example from our recent research: a hierarchical model fit to public-opinion survey data. 1. Simulate three or more chains in parallel. We typically obtain starting points by adding random perturbations to crude estimates based on a simpler model or approximation. 2. Check convergence by discarding the first part of the simulations—we discard the first half, although that may be overly conservative—and using within-chain analysis to monitor stationarity and between/within chains comparisons to monitor mixing. 3. Once you have reached approximate convergence, mix all the simulations fromthe second halves of the chains together to summarize the target distribution. For most purposes there is no longer any need to worry about autocorrelations in the chains. 4. Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)—for example, tuning the jumping distribution of a Metropolis algorithm—can often be a good idea and presents no problems for convergence if you restart after adapting. For example, if you have already run 400 iterations and have not reached approximate convergence, you can adjust your algorithm and runanother 400 steps, discarding the earlier simulations. At the next step of adaptation, you can run another 400, and so forth, possibly adapting the adaptation time itself to balance the goals of rapid convergence and computational efficiency. (Newer, more sophisticated algorithms have the promise of allowing continuous adaptation and do not necessarily require discarding early iterations.) 4. Adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)—for example, tuning the jumping distribution of a Metropolis algorithm—can often be a good idea and presents no problems for convergence if you restart after adapting. For example, if you have already run 400 iterations and have not reached approximate convergence, you can adjust your algorithm and runanother 400 steps, discarding the earlier simulations. At the next step of adaptation, you can run another 400, and so forth, possibly adapting the adaptation time itself to balance the goals of rapid convergence and computational efficiency. (Newer, more sophisticated algorithms have the promise of allowing continuous adaptation and do not necessarily require discarding early iterations.) 5. If you have run your simulations for a while and they are not close to conver- gence, stop, look at plots of simulations from different chains, and go back and improve your algorithm, for example, by adding new kinds of jumps to get faster mixing (see, e.g., Sections 11.8 through 11.9 of Gelman et al., 2003, for some simple approaches, or some of the chapters in this handbook for more advanced ideas for tackling harder problems). It is not generally a good idea to wait hours for conver- gence, and in many practical examples there is a real gain from getting an answer in ten seconds, say, rather than two minutes. Faster computation translates into the ability to fit more models and to do more real-time data analysis. 6. When all is done, compare inferences to those from simpler models or approxima- tions. Examine discrepancies to see whether they represent programming errors, poor convergence, or actual changes in inferences as the model is expanded. (Here we are talking about using these comparisons as a way to diagnose potential prob- lems in a simulation. Other chapters in this handbook discuss ways of combining MCMC runs from different models to perform more efficient computations, using techniques such as parallel tempering and path sampling.) Another useful debugging technique is the fake-data check: Choose or simulate some “true values” of the parameters and simulate data given these parameters. Then run the MCMCalgorithm and check that it converges to a distribution consistent with the assumed true parameter values.∗ To illustrate the concepts in this chapter, we introduce a model fit using MCMC that comes from a political science application: modeling state-level attitudes on the death penalty over time using national survey data (Shirley and Gelman, 2010). The model is a multilevel logistic regression for the binary response representing support ( y = 1) or oppo- sition ( y = 0) to the death penalty for people convicted of murder (this is how the question was phrased in repeated polls given by Gallup and the National Opinion Research Center during the time span 1953–2006). The predictors in the model include demographics such as race, sex, and age, as well as the state of residence of the respondent (nested within one of four regions of the United States), so that we can model opinion trends in different parts of the country.},

(2013) recommended fitting ‘maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too com- plex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification. Finally, we clarify that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are atyp- ical for real data. A detailed example is provided of how subject-related attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.},

Speed-accuracy tradeoff modeling in Experiments 1 and 3 indicated that clefting did not affect the speed of accessing an antecedent representation, which is inconsistent with claims that discourse-focused information is actively maintained in focal attention [e.g., Gundel, J. K. (1999). On different kinds of focus. In P. Bosch {\&} R. van der Sandt, (Eds.), Focus: Linguistic, cognitive, and computational perspectives. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press]. Rather, clefting simply increased the likelihood of retrieving the antecedent representation, suggesting that clefting only increases the strength of a representation in memory. Eye fixation measures in Experiment 2 showed that clefting did not affect early bonding of the pronoun and antecedent, but did ease later integration. Collectively, the results indicate that clefting made antecedent representations more distinctive in working memory, hence more available for subsequent discourse operations. Pronoun type also affected resolution processes. Gendered pronouns (he or she) were interpreted more accurately than an ungendered pronoun (it), and in one case, earlier in time-course. We argue that both effects are due to the greater ambiguity of it, as a cue to retrieve the correct antecedent representation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The challenge in a Bayesian analysis is to formulate a suitably vague alternative, because the vaguer the alternative is (the more it spreads out the unit mass of prior probability), the more the null is favored. A general solution is a sensitivity analysis: Compute the odds for or against the null as a function of the limit(s) on the vagueness of the alternative. If the odds on the null approach 1 from above as the hypothesized maximum size of the possible effect approaches 0, then the data favor the null over any vaguer alternative to it. The simple computations and the intuitive graphic representation of the analysis are illustrated by the analysis of diverse examples from the current literature.

The model uses probabilistic parsing techniques, which combine phrase structure, lexical category, and limited subcategory probabilities with an incremental, left-to-right "pruning" mechanism based on cascaded Markov models. The parameters of the system are established through a uniform training algorithm, which determines maximum-likelihood estimates from a parsed corpus. The probabilistic parsing mechanism enables the system to achieve good accuracy on typical, "garden-variety" language (i.e., when tested on corpora). Furthermore, the incremental probabilistic ranking of the preferred analyses during parsing also naturally explains observed human behavior for a range of garden-path structures. We do not make strong psychological claims about the specific probabilistic mechanism discussed here, which is limited by a number of practical considerations. Rather, we argue incremental probabilistic parsing models are, in general, extremely well suited to explaining this dual nature-generally good and occasionally pathological-of human linguistic performance.},

Postverbal noun phrases in these sentences could be ambiguously attached as either a direct object or the subject of a sentence complement, whereas in unambiguous versions of the sentences the subcategorization of the verb forced the direct object interpretation. Participants read these sentences in relatively long paragraph contexts, where the context supported the direct object analysis ("preferred"), supported the sentence complement analysis ("unpreferred"), or provided conflicting evidence about both analyses ("conflicting"). Self-paced reading times for ambiguous postverbal noun phrases were almost equivalent to the reading times of their unambiguous counterparts, even in unpreferred and conflicted context conditions. However, time to read a following region, which forced the direct object interpretation, was affected by the interaction of verb subcategorization ambiguity and contextual support. The full pattern of results do not fit well with either an unelaborated single-analysis ("garden path") model or a competitive constraint-satisfaction model, but are consistent with a race model in which multiple factors affect the speed of constructing a single initial analysis.},

abstract = {The mapping between the physical speech signal and our internal representations is rarely straightforward. When faced with uncertainty, higher-order information is used to parse the signal and because of this, the lexicon and some aspects of sentential context have been shown to modulate the identification of ambiguous phonetic segments. Here, using a phoneme identification task (i.e., participants judged whether they heard [o] or [a] at the end of an adjective in a noun– adjective sequence), we asked whether grammatical gender cues influence phonetic identification and if this influence is shaped by the phonetic properties of the agreeing elements. In three experiments, we show that phrase-level gender agreement in Spanish affects the identification of ambiguous adjective-final vowels. Moreover, this effect is strongest when the phonetic characteristics of the element triggering agreement and the phonetic form of the agreeing element are identical. Our data are consistent with models wherein listeners generate specific predictions based on the interplay of underlying morphosyntactic knowledge and surface phonetic cues.},

The benefit of Vincentizing is that the resulting histogram "looks like" an average of the individuals. In this article, we competitively test Vincentizing against the more mundane approach of averaging parameter estimates from fits to individuals. We simulate data from three distributions: the ex-Gaussian, the Weibull, and the shifted-Wald. For the ex-Gaussian and the shifted-Wald, parameter averaging outperforms Vincentizing. There is only an advantage of Vincentizing for the Weibull and only when there are few observations per participant. Overall, we recommend that researchers use Vincentizing only in select circumstances and with the knowledge that Vincentized estimates are often inconsistent estimators of averaged parameters.},

Recognition memory dynamics were studied by the method of A. V. Reed (see PA, Vol 51:2421): Present an A-B pair; wait a variable lag; present a signal to make a yes-no response within 200 msec. There were 6 Ss. Recall strength was about half of recognition strength, compatible with the hypothesis that recall tapped only the forward association, while recognition used both forward and backward associations. Memory retrieval dynamics in recall and recognition appeared identical. The A-B, A-C associative interference had a small retarding effect on retrieval dynamics for an A-B association, and the effect was about the same for recall and recognition. The effect was approximately half that predicted by the simples t serial search model of memory retrieval. Findings are compatible with a direct-access model for retrieval, with interference producing a modest retardation in both recognition and recall dynamics.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Cognitive Science Society, Inc. Given the replication crisis in cognitive science, it is important to consider what researchers need to do in order to report results that are reliable. We consider three changes in current practice that have the potential to deliver more realistic and robust claims. First, the planned experiment should be divided into two stages, an exploratory stage and a confirmatory stage. This clear separation allows the researcher to check whether any results found in the exploratory stage are robust. The second change is to carry out adequately powered studies. We show that this is imperative if we want to obtain realistic estimates of effects in psycholinguistics. The third change is to use Bayesian data-analytic methods rather than frequentist ones; the Bayesian framework allows us to focus on the best estimates we can obtain of the effect, rather than rejecting a strawman null. As a case study, we investigate number interference effects in German. Number feature interference is predicted by cue-based retrieval models of sentence processing (Van Dyke {\&} Lewis, 2003; Vasishth {\&} Lewis, 2006), but it has shown inconsistent results. We show that by implementing the three changes mentioned, suggestive evidence emerges that is consistent with the predicted number interference effects.},

In self-paced reading and event-related brain potential (ERP) experiments, we used materials in which the likelihood of a specific patient noun (brakes or spelling) depended on the combination of an agent and verb (mechanic checked vs. journalist checked). Reading times were shorter at the word directly following the patient for the congruent than the incongruent items. Differential N400s were found earlier, immediately at the patient. Norming studies ruled out any account of these results based on direct relations between the agent and patient. Thus, comprehenders dynamically combine information about real-world events based on intrasentential agents and verbs, and this combination then rapidly influences online sentence interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Jones and Dzhafarov (2014) claim that several current models of speeded decision making in cognitive tasks, including the diffusion model, can be viewed as special cases of other general models or model classes. The general models can be made to match any set of response time (RT) distribution and accuracy data exactly by a suitable choice of parameters and so are unfalsifiable. The implication of their claim is that models like the diffusion model are empirically testable only by artificially restricting them to exclude unfalsifiable instances of the general model. We show that Jones and Dzhafarov's argument depends on enlarging the class of “diffusion” models to include models in which there is little or no diffusion. The unfalsifiable models are deterministic or near-deterministic growth models, from which the effects of within-trial variability have been removed or in which they are constrained to be negligible. These models attribute most or all of the variability in RT and accuracy to across-trial variability in the rate of evidence growth, which is permitted to be distributed arbitrarily and to vary freely across experimental conditions. In contrast, in the standard diffusion model, within-trial variability in evidence is the primary determinant of variability in RT. Across-trial variability, which determines the relative speed of correct responses and errors, is theoretically and empirically constrained. Jones and Dzhafarov's attempt to include the diffusion model in a class of models that also includes deterministic growth models misrepresents and trivializes it and conveys a misleading picture of cognitive decision-making research.

In a replication of Staub (2011), ex-Gaussian fitting demonstrated that the low predictability distribution was significantly shifted to the right of the high predictability distribution in the absence of any contextual differences in the degree of skew. Extending this finding, the present study used a survival analysis technique to demonstrate a significant influence of predictability on fixation duration as early as 140 ms from the start of fixation, which is similar to prior results obtained with the word frequency variable. These results provide convergent evidence that lexical variables have a fast acting influence on fixation durations during reading. Implications for models of eye- movement control are discussed.},

comprehension by measuring pupillary response during reading. Two
experiments contrast the processing of simpler versus more complex
sentences. The two more complex sentence types, object-relative center-embedded
sentences and filler-gap sentences, not only take longer to process
than their simpler counterparts, but they also produce a larger change
in pupil diameter. We propose that the pupillary response is an indicator
of how intensely the processing system is operating. The more complex
sentences evoke some intense processing at the point in the sentence
where a syntactic complexity is first encountered. The gaze durations
at these points are elevated, indicating the immediate response to
the demand of the syntactic processing. The pupil then starts to
dilate, reaching a maximal diameter approximately 1.3 s later. The
results from these various performance measures are integrated within
a resource-limited computational model of comprehension. The paper
develops a model of comprehension that includes an intensity dimension
of thought, drawing a correspondence between the computational model's
consumption of resources and the human pupillary response.},

@article{Kush2015,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t Formal grammatical theories make extensive use of syntactic relations (e.g. c-command, Reinhart, 1983) in the description of constraints on antecedent-anaphor dependencies. Recent research has motivated a model of processing that exploits a cue-based retrieval mechanism in content-addressable memory (e.g. Lewis, Vasishth, {\&} Van Dyke, 2006) in which item-to-item syntactic relations such as c-command are difficult to use as retrieval cues. As such, the c-command constraints of formal grammars are predicted to be poorly implemented by the retrieval mechanism. We tested whether memory access mechanisms are able to exploit relational information by investigating the processing of bound variable pronouns, a form of anaphoric dependency that imposes a c-command restriction on antecedent-pronoun relations. A quantificational NP (QP, e.g., no janitor) must c-command a pronoun in order to bind it. We contrasted the retrieval of QPs with the retrieval of referential NPs (e.g. the janitor), which can co-refer with a pronoun in the absence of c-command. In three off-line judgment studies and two eye-tracking studies, we show that referential NPs are easily accessed as antecedents, irrespective of whether they c-command the pronoun, but that quantificational NPs are accessed as antecedents only when they c-command the pronoun. These results are unexpected under theories that hold that retrieval exclusively uses a limited set of content features as retrieval cues. Our results suggest either that memory access mechanisms can make use of relational information as a guide for retrieval, or that the set of features that is used to encode syntactic relations in memory must be enriched.},

abstract = {Psycholinguistic research, like much of cognitive science, is in the midst of a vigorous inquiry into the role of pre- dictive mechanisms (DeLong, Urbach, {\&} Kutas, 2005; Dikker, Rabagliati, {\&} Pylkannen, 2009; Kamide, Altmann, {\&} Haywood, 2003; Kim {\&} Gilley, 2013; Van Petten {\&} Luka, 2012). This inquiry seeks to explain how language comprehension is not only a process of responding to the linguistic input that arrives at our senses, but also of anticipating that linguistic input based on what we have encountered so far. Given the many combinatory regularities in language that could support such guesses about what is likely to follow, it is not surprising that predictive mechanisms are employed during language comprehension. Prediction may be crucial to explaining how we can recognise and combine word meanings quickly enough to keep up with the rapidly unfolding linguistic input – some of the critical compu- tations are prepared in advance. We comment here on an investigation by Chow, Smith, Lau, {\&} Phillips (2015) into two interesting and important aspects of this larger question: How do we predict upcoming verbs as we comprehend sentences? And how are predictions constrained by limitations in processing resources and available time?},

abstract = {Four theories of the human conceptual system-semantic memory, exemplar models, feed-forward connectionist nets, and situated simulation theory-are characterised and contrasted on five dimensions: (1) architecture (modular vs. non-modular), (2) representation (amodal vs. modal), (3) abstraction (decontextualised vs. situated), (4) stability (stable vs. dynamical), and (5) organisation (taxonomic vs. action-environment interface). Empirical evidence is then reviewed for the situated simulation theory, and the following conclusions are reached. Because the conceptual system shares mechanisms with perception and action, it is non-modular. As a result, conceptual representations are multi-modal simulations distributed across modality-specific systems. A given simulation for a concept is situated, preparing an agent for situated action with a particular instance, in a particular setting. Because a concept delivers diverse simulations that prepare agents for action in many different situations, it is dynamical. Because the conceptual system's primary purpose is to support situated action, it becomes organised around the action-environment interface.},

abstract = {The inhibition of return (IOR) phenomenon is routinely considered an effect of reflexive attention because the paradigm used to generate IOR employs peripheral cues that are uninformative as to where a target will appear. Because the cues are spatially unreliable it is thought that there is no reason for attention to be committed volitionally to them, and hence, the IOR effect is considered reflexive. What has been generally overlooked, however, is that the cues provide reliable temporal information as to when a target will occur. This predictive information is used by participants to prepare volitionally for when a target is likely to appear. We investigated whether the IOR effect is a product of the volitional application of attention to peripheral cues for the use of their temporal information. To test this idea we rendered the temporal information provided by peripheral cues unreliable. While this eliminated participants using the cues volitionally, it did not abolish the IOR phenomenon. These data demonstrate two new findings. First, the IOR effect is fundamentally a reflexive phenomenon. Second, when peripheral cues are not used volitionally, the IOR effect is attenuated. Together, the present findings indicate that the IOR effect can be modulated by volitional (top-down) processes but it is not the product of them. We argue that an intimate link between fronto-parietal regions and the superior colliculus provide a functional neural mechanism for this volitional effect to impact IOR.},

abstract = {We report analytical and computational investigations into the effects of base time on the diagnosticity of two popular theoretical tools in the redundant signals literature: (1) the race model inequality and (2) the capacity coefficient. We show analytically and without distributional assumptions that the presence of base time decreases the sensitivity of both of these measures to model violations. We further use simulations to investigate the statistical power model selection tools based on the race model inequality, both with and without base time. Base time decreases statistical power, and biases the race model test toward conservatism. The magnitude of this biasing effect increases as we increase the proportion of total reaction time variance contributed by base time. We marshal empirical evidence to suggest that the proportion of reaction time variance contributed by base time is relatively small, and that the effects of base time on the diagnosticity of our model-selection tools are therefore likely to be minor. However, uncertainty remains concerning the magnitude and even the definition of base time. Experimentalists should continue to be alert to situations in which base time may contribute a large proportion of the total reaction time variance},

abstract = {Attraction interference in language comprehension and production may be as a result of common or different processes. In the present paper, we investigate attraction interference during language comprehension, focusing on the contexts in which interference arises and the time-course of these effects. Using evidence from event-related brain potentials (ERPs) and sentence judgment times, we show that agreement attraction in comprehension is best explained as morphosyntactic interference during memory retrieval. This stands in contrast to attraction as involving the representation of the subject NP's root-node number feature, which is a strong contributor to attraction in production. We thus argue that the cognitive antecedents of agreement attraction in comprehension are non-identical with those of attraction in production, and moreover, that attraction in comprehension is primarily a consequence of similarity-based interference in cue-based memory retrieval processes. We suggest that mechanisms responsible for attraction during language comprehension are a subset of those involved in language production. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The Principle A of Chomsky's (1981) Binding Theory requires the reflexive pronoun in a sentence to be bound to its antecedent within its governing category. However, in Chinese sentences with a common structure "P-NP(1)+VP(1)+P-NP(2)+VP(2)+ziji", in which the P-NP stands for personal name and the reflexive ziji (standing for myself, himself, herself, yourself, ourselves etc., depending on context) is at the object position, ziji can refer to either the local subject (P-NP(2), local reference) or the matrix or main subject (P-NP(1), long-distance reference) or both (ambiguous reference), depending on properties of VP(2). This study investigates whether this violation of Principle A comes with processing costs during sentence comprehension. In an event-related potential (ERP) experiment we found that, as compared with the local reference condition, ERP responses to ziji were significantly more positive in the long-distance reference condition. This pattern appeared on both P300 and P600. It is suggested that linking the reflexive with a distant, rather than a local, antecedent during sentence comprehension requires more processing resources. While the P300 effect may reflect the detection of incongruence between the mental representation based on Principle A and the representation based on the processing of local verb, the P600 effect may be associated with a second-pass integration process that links the reflexive with the matrix subject.},

Individual differences in the reported use of effective strategies accounted for substantial variance in span performance.

Measures of processing speed accounted for a substantial proportion of the age-related variance in span performance.

In some blocks, informative cues indicated the side of upcoming singleton targets that were present on most trials among uniform distractors. In other blocks, cues were spatially uninformative, and no preparatory shifts of attention were possible. The N2pc in response to targets was unaffected by this manipulation, showing that this component is not associated with attention shifts.

abstract = {Successful language use requires access to products of past processing within an evolving discourse. A central issue for any neurocognitive theory of language then concerns the role of memory variables during language processing. Under a cue-based retrieval account of language comprehension, linguistic dependency resolution (e.g., retrieving antecedents) is subject to interference from other information in the sentence, especially information that occurs between the words that form the dependency (e.g., between the antecedent and the retrieval site). Retrieval interference may then shape processing complexity as a function of the match of the information at retrieval with the antecedent versus other recent or similar items in memory. To address these issues, we studied the online processing of ellipsis in Castilian Spanish, a language with morphological gender agreement. We recorded event-related brain potentials while participants read sentences containing noun-phrase ellipsis indicated by the determiner otro/a ('another'). These determiners had a grammatically correct or incorrect gender with respect to their antecedent nouns that occurred earlier in the sentence. Moreover, between each antecedent and determiner, another noun phrase occurred that was structurally unavailable as an antecedent and that matched or mismatched the gender of the antecedent (i.e., a local agreement attractor). In contrast to extant P600 results on agreement violation processing, and inconsistent with predictions from neurocognitive models of sentence processing, grammatically incorrect determiners evoked a sustained, broadly distributed negativity compared to correct ones between 400 and 1000. ms after word onset, possibly related to sustained negativities as observed for referential processing difficulties. Crucially, this effect was modulated by the attractor: an increased negativity was observed for grammatically correct determiners that did not match the gender of the attractor, suggesting that structurally unavailable noun phrases were at least temporarily considered for grammatically correct ellipsis. These results constitute the first ERP evidence for cue-based retrieval interference during comprehension of grammatical sentences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {According to some current theories, the focus of attention (FOA), part of working memory, represents items in a privileged state that is more accessible than items stored in other memory systems. One line of evidence supporting the distinction between the FOA and other memory systems is the finding that items in the FOA are immune to proactive interference (when something learned earlier impairs the ability to remember something learned more recently). The FOA, then, is held to be unique: it is the only memory system that is not susceptible to proactive interference. We review the literature used to support this claim, and although there are many studies in which proactive interference was not observed, we found more studies in which it was observed. We conclude that the FOA is not immune to proactive interference: items in the FOA are susceptible to proactive interference just like items in every other memory system. And, just as in all other memory systems, it is how the items are represented and processed that plays a critical role in determining whether proactive interference will be observed.},

@article{Lago2017,
abstract = {Previous studies have shown that speakers of languages such as German, Spanish, and French reactivate the syntactic gender of the antecedent of a pronoun to license gender agreement. As syntactic gender is assumed to be stored in the lexicon, this has motivated the claim that pronouns in these languages reactivate the lexical entry of their antecedent noun. In contrast, in languages without syntactic gender such as English, lexical retrieval might be unnecessary. We used eye-tracking while reading to examine whether antecedent retrieval involves rapid semantic and phonological reactivation. We compared German and English. In German, we found early sensitivity to the semantic but not to the phonological features of the pronoun's antecedent. In English, readers did not immediately show either semantic or phonological effects specific to coreference. We propose that early semantic facilitation arises due to syntactic gender reactivation, and that antecedent retrieval varies cross-linguistically depending on the type of information relevant to the grammar of each language.

abstract = {In two experiments, we explored the use of event-related brain potentials to selectively track the processes that establish reference during spoken language comprehension. Subjects listened to stories in which a particular noun phrase like "the girl" either uniquely referred to a single referent mentioned in the earlier discourse, or ambiguously referred to two equally suitable referents. Referentially ambiguous nouns ("the girl" with two girls introduced in the discourse context) elicited a frontally dominant and sustained negative shift in brain potentials, emerging within 300-400 ms after acoustic noun onset. The early onset of this effect reveals that reference to a discourse entity can be established very rapidly. Its morphology and distribution suggest that at least some of the processing consequences of referential ambiguity may involve an increased demand on memory resources. Furthermore, because this referentially induced ERP effect is very different from that of well-known ERP effects associated with the semantic (N400) and syntactic (e.g., P600/SPS) aspects of language comprehension, it suggests that ERPs can be used to selectively keep track of three major processes involved in the comprehension of an unfolding piece of discourse.},

abstract = {The most powerful tests of response time (RT) models often involve the whole shape of the RT distribution, thus avoiding mimicking that can occur at the level of RT means and variances. Nonparametric distribution estimation is, in principle, the most appropriate approach, but such estimators are sometimes difficult to obtain. On the other hand, distribution fitting, given an algebraic function, is both easy and compact. We review the general approach to performing distribution fitting with maximum likelihood (ML) and a method based on quantiles (quantile maximum probability, QMP). We show that QMP has both small bias and good efficiency when used with common distribution functions (the ex-Gaussian, Gumbel, lognormal, Wald, and Weibull distributions). In addition, we review some software packages performing ML (PASTIS, QMPE, DISFIT, and MATHEMATICA) and compare their results. In general, the differences between packages have little influence on the optimal solution found, but the form of the distribution function has: Both the lognormal and the Wald distributions have non-linear dependencies between the parameter estimates that tend to increase the overall bias in parameter recovery and to decrease efficiency. We conclude by laying out a few pointers on how to relate descriptive models of RT to cognitive models of RT. A program that generated the random deviates used in our studies may be downloaded from www.psychonomic.org/archive/.},

abstract = {Results from two self-paced reading experiments in English are reported in which subject- and object-extracted relative clauses (SRCs and ORCs, respectively) were presented in contexts that support both types of relative clauses (RCs). Object-extracted versions were read more slowly than subject-extracted versions across both experiments. These results are not consistent with a decay-based working memory account of dependency formation where the amount of decay is a function of the number of new discourse referents that intervene between the dependents (Gibson, 1998; Warren {\&} Gibson, 2002). Rather, these results support interference-based accounts and decay-based accounts where the amount of decay depends on the number of words or on the type of noun phrases that intervene between the dependents. In Experiment 2, presentation in supportive contexts was directly contrasted with presentation in null contexts. Whereas in the null context the extraction effect was only observed during the RC region, in a supportive context the extraction effect was numerically larger and persisted into the following region, thus showing that extraction effects are enhanced in supportive contexts. A sentence completion study demonstrated that the rate of SRCs versus ORCs was similar across null and supportive contexts (with most completions being subject-extractions), ruling out the possibility that an enhanced extraction effect in supportive contexts is due to ORCs being less expected in such contexts. However, the content of the RCs differed between contexts in the completions, such that the RCs produced in supportive contexts were more constrained, reflecting the lexical and semantic content of the preceding context. This effect, which we discuss in terms of expectations/lexico-syntactic priming, suggests that the enhancement of the extraction effect in supportive contexts is due to the facilitation of the subject-extracted condition.},

Internet users are exposed to repeated visual displays, the Web provides
ideal stimuli to test this theory. Eye movement data were recorded
for subjects' repeated viewings of three Web pages over three sessions.
Resemblance of eye path sequences was measured with a string-edit
method; multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to
group sequences. Support was found for the scanpath theory; some
clusters included pairs of sequences from the same subject. A repeated
measures analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant
main effect for stimulus type, with a text-intensive news story page
generating more similar sequences than a graphic-intensive advertising
page. There was a statistically significant main effect for cross-viewing
comparisons, reflecting a linear trend in which eye paths for the

abstract = {In psycholinguistic studies using error rates as a response measure, response times (RT) are most often analyzed independently of the error rate, although it is widely recognized that they are related. In this paper we present a mixed effects logistic regression model for the error rate that uses RT as a trial-level fixed- and random-effect regression input. Production data from a translation-recall experiment are analyzed as an example. Several model comparisons reveal that RT improves the fit of the regression model for the error rate. Two simulation studies then show how the mixed effects regression model can identify individual participants for whom (a) faster responses are more accurate, (b) faster responses are less accurate, or (c) there is no relation between speed and accuracy. These results show that this type of model can serve as a useful adjunct to traditional techniques, allowing psycholinguistic researchers to examine more closely the relationship between RT and accuracy in individual subjects and better account for the variability which may be present, as well as a preliminary step to more advanced RT-accuracy modeling. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A popular procedure for investigating working memory processes has been the visual change-detection procedure. Models of performance based on that procedure, however, tend to be based on performance accuracy and treat working memory search as a one-step process, in which memory representations are compared to a test probe to determine if a match is present. To gain a clearer understanding of how search of these representations operate in the change-detection task, we examined reaction time in two experiments, with a single-item probe either located centrally or at the location of an array item. Contrary to current models of visual working memory capacity, our data point to a two-stage search process: In addition to these results, we found that participants tended not to use location information provided by the probe that theoretically could have abbreviated the search process. We suggest some basic revisions of current models of processing in this type of visual working memory task.},

abstract = {In communicating events by gesture, participants create codes that recapitulate the patterns of word order in the world's vocal languages (Gibson et al., 2013; Goldin-Meadow, So, Ozyurek, {\&} Mylander, 2008; Hall, Mayberry, {\&} Ferreria, 2013; Hall, Ferreira, {\&} Mayberry, 2014; Langus {\&} Nespor, 2010; and others). Participants most often convey simple transitive events using gestures in the order Subject-Object-Verb (SOV), the most common word order in human languages. When there is a possibility of confusion between subject and object, participants use the order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). This overall pattern has been explained by positing an underlying cognitive preference for subject-initial, verb-final orders, with the verb-medial order SVO order emerging to facilitate robust communication in a noisy channel (Gibson et al., 2013). However, whether the subject-initial and verb-final biases are innate or the result of languages that the participants already know has been unclear, because participants in previous studies all spoke either SVO or SOV languages, which could induce a subject-initial, verb-late bias. Furthermore, the exact manner in which known languages influence gestural orders has been unclear. In this paper we demonstrate that there is a subject-initial and verb-final gesturing bias cross-linguistically by comparing gestures of speakers of SVO languages English and Russian to those of speakers of VSO languages Irish and Tagalog. The findings show that subject-initial and verb-final order emerges even in speakers of verb-initial languages, and that interference from these languages takes the form of occasionally gesturing in VSO order, without an additional bias toward other orders. The results provides further support for the idea that improvised gesture is a window into the pressures shaping language formation, independently of the languages that participants already know.},

abstract = {Seven experiments using self-paced reading and eyetracking suggest that omitting the middle verb in a double centre embedding leads to easier processing in English but leads to greater difficulty in German. One commonly accepted explanation for the English pattern—based on data from offline acceptability ratings and due to Gibson and Thomas (1999)—is that working-memory overload leads the comprehender to forget the prediction of the upcoming verb phrase (VP), which reduces working-memory load. We show that this VP-forgetting hypothesis does an excellent job of explaining the English data, but cannot account for the German results. We argue that the English and German results can be explained by the parser's adaptation to the grammatical properties of the languages; in contrast to English, German subordinate clauses always have the verb in clause-final position, and this property of German may lead the German parser to maintain predictions of upcoming VPs more robustly compared to English. The evidence thus argues against language-independent forgetting effects in online sentence processing; working-memory constraints can be conditioned by countervailing influences deriving from grammatical properties of the language under study.},

Following different questions in wh-question-answer pairs (e.g. What kind of vegetable did Ming buy for cooking today?/Who bought the vegetables for cooking today?), the answer sentences (e.g., Ming bought eggplant/beef to cook today.) contained a critical word, which was either semantically appropriate (eggplant) or inappropriate (beef), and either focus or non-focus. The results showed a full N400 effect only when the critical words were in focus position. In non-focus position a strongly reduced N400 effect was observed, in line with the well-known semantic illusion effect. The results suggest that information structure facilitates semantic processing by devoting more resources to focused information.},

abstract = {We review the development and extensions of the classical total least squares method and describe algorithms for its generalization to weighted and structured approximation problems. In the generic case, the classical total least squares problem has a unique solution, which is given in analytic form in terms of the singular value de-composition of the data matrix. The weighted and structured total least squares problems have no such analytic solution and are currently solved numerically by local optimization methods. We explain how special structure of the weight matrix and the data matrix can be exploited for efficient cost function and first derivative computation. This allows to obtain computationally efficient solution methods. The total least squares family of methods has a wide range of applications in system theory, signal processing, and computer algebra. We describe the applications for deconvolution, linear prediction, and errors-in-variables system identification.},

@article{Bott2012,
abstract = {Scalar implicatures are inferences that arise when a weak expression is used instead of a stronger alternative. For example, when a speaker says, " Some of the children are in the classroom," she often implies that not all of them are. Recent processing studies of scalar implicatures have argued that generating an implicature carries a cost. In this study we investigated this cost using a sentence verification task similar to that of Bott and Noveck (2004) combined with a response deadline procedure to estimate speed and accuracy independently. Experiment 1 compared implicit upper-bound interpretations (some [but not all]) with lower-bound interpretations (some [and possibly all]). Experiment 2 compared an implicit upper-bound meaning of some with the explicit upper-bound meaning of only some. Experiment 3 compared an implicit lower-bound meaning of some with the explicit lower-bound meaning of at least some. Sentences with implicatures required additional processing time that could not be attributed to retrieval probabilities or factors relating to semantic complexity. Our results provide evidence against several different types of processing models, including verification and nonverification default implicature models and cost-free contextual models. More generally, our data are the first to provide evidence of the costs associated with deriving implicatures per se. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The question is posed how intuitions concerning linguistic tokens can inform a theory of linguistic types.

These models are rational in the sense that they strive to find a good syntactic analysis quickly. Informed search derives a new account of garden pathing that handles traditional counterexamples.

@article{Piantadosi2014,
abstract = {Absolute linguistic universals are often justified by cross-linguistic analysis: If all observed languages exhibit a property, the property is taken to be a likely universal, perhaps specified in the cognitive or linguistic systems of language learners and users. In many cases, these patterns are then taken to motivate linguistic theory. Here, we show that cross-linguistic analysis will very rarely be able to statistically justify absolute, inviolable patterns in language. We formalize two statistical methods-frequentist and Bayesian-and show that in both it is possible to find strict linguistic universals, but that the numbers of independent languages necessary to do so is generally unachievable. This suggests that methods other than typological statistics are necessary to establish absolute properties of human language, and thus that many of the purported universals in linguistics have not received sufficient empirical justification.},

@article{XiangEtAl:2013,
abstract = {Previous psycholinguistics studies have shown that when forming a long distance dependency in online processing, the parser sometimes accepts a sentence even though the required grammatical constraints are only partially met. A mechanistic account of how such errors arise sheds light on both the underlying linguistic representations involved and the processing mechanisms that put such representations together. In the current study, we contrast the negative polarity items (NPI) interference effect, as shown by the acceptance of an ungrammatical sentence like "The bills that democratic senators have voted for will ever become law," with the well-known phenomenon of agreement attraction ("The key to the cabinets are {\ldots} "). On the surface, these two types of errors look alike and thereby can be explained as being driven by the same source: similarity based memory interference. However, we argue that the linguistic representations involved in NPI licensing are substantially different from those of subject-verb agreement, and therefore the interference effects in each domain potentially arise from distinct sources. In particular, we show that NPI interference at least partially arises from pragmatic inferences. In a self-paced reading study with an acceptability judgment task, we showed NPI interference was modulated by participants' general pragmatic communicative skills, as quantified by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ, Baron-Cohen et al., 2001), especially in offline tasks. Participants with more autistic traits were actually less prone to the NPI interference effect than those with fewer autistic traits. This result contrasted with agreement attraction conditions, which were not influenced by individual pragmatic skill differences. We also show that different NPI licensors seem to have distinct interference profiles. We discuss two kinds of interference effects for NPI licensing: memory-retrieval based and pragmatically triggered.},

abstract = {Participants' eye movements were recorded as they read single sentences presented normally, presented entirely in faint text, or presented normally except for a single faint word. Fixations were longer when the entire sentence was faint than when the sentence was presented normally. In addition, fixations were much longer on a single faint word embedded in normal text, compared to when the entire sentence was faint. The primary aim of the study was to examine the influence of stimulus quality on the distribution of fixation durations. Ex-Gaussian fitting revealed that stimulus quality affected the mean of the Normal component, but in contrast to results from single-word tasks (Plourde {\&} Besner, 1997), stimulus quality did not affect the exponential component, regardless of whether one or all words were faint. The results also contrast with the finding (Staub, White, Drieghe, Hollway, {\&} Rayner, 2010) that the word frequency effect on fixation durations is an effect on both of the critical distributional parameters. These findings are argued to have implications for the interpretation of the role of stimulus quality in word recognition, and for models of eye movement control in reading.

abstract = {This dissertation asks two main questions for Turkish: (i) what is the interaction between verbal morphology and the structure?, and (ii) what is the interaction between word order and interpretation? Following Kornfilt (1996) I argue that there are two verbal forms in finite structures: one consists of a participle and a copula, which is inflected for tense and agreement, and the other is a fully inflected verbal form. I propose that the former is formed by a derivation in which the verb moves as far as a functional head such Aspect or Modal, creating a participle. A verbal feature (copula) is inserted at T o satisfying its verbal requirement. In the latter case the verb moves all the way up to T o . No copula is inserted. The rest of the dissertation focuses on the interaction between structure and quantificational elements. One question addressed is why indefinites marked overtly for accusative case violate scope rigidity, and are interpreted as having wide scope over quantificational elements c-commanding them. It is argued that they do not violate scope rigidity, but rather the unexpected wide scope interpretation is the result of a special interpretative mechanism. Accusative-marked indefinites are interpreted as choice functions. Structures with various quantifiers, indefinites and negative polarity items are discussed, and it is argued that the interpretation of both choice function variables and negative polarity items are subject to intervention effects. Finally, structures with clausal possessives are analyzed. The discussion focuses on one type of clausal possessive in which the possessor is in the genitive case and the possessee agrees with the possessor. It is shown that this construction is subject to a constraint similar to the there-sentences in English in that the possessee cannot be presuppositional. It is argued that the possessor is generated in a constituent within VP with the possessee, but raises to the [Spec, TP]. The possessee remains within VP, and is interpreted non-presuppositionally.},

@article{TuckerEtAl:2015,
abstract = {In the processing of subject-verb agreement, non-subject plural nouns following a singular subject sometimes "attract" the agreement with the verb, despite not being grammatically licensed to do so. This phenomenon generates agreement errors in production and an increased tendency to fail to notice such errors in comprehension, thereby providing a window into the representation of grammatical number in working memory during sentence processing. Research in this topic, however, is primarily done in related languages with similar agreement systems. In order to increase the cross-linguistic coverage of the processing of agreement, we conducted a self-paced reading study in Modern Standard Arabic.We report robust agreement attraction errors in relative clauses, a configuration not particularly conducive to the generation of such errors for all possible lexicalizations. In particular, we examined the speed with which readers retrieve a subject controller for both grammatical and ungrammatical agreeing verbs in sentences where verbs are preceded by two NPs, one of which is a local non-subject NP that can act as a distractor for the successful resolution of subject-verb agreement. Our results suggest that the frequency of errors is modulated by the kind of plural formation strategy used on the attractor noun: nouns which form plurals by suffixation condition high rates of attraction, whereas nouns which form their plurals by internal vowel change (ablaut) generate lower rates of errors and reading-time attraction effects of smaller magnitudes. Furthermore, we show some evidence that these agreement attraction effects are mostly contained in the right tail of reaction time distributions. We also present modeling data in the ACT-R framework which supports a view of these ablauting patterns wherein they are differentially specified for number and evaluate the consequences of possible representations for theories of grammar and parsing.},

Seventy-one non-college-bound 16-24. year-old speakers of English completed a battery of 18 verbal and cognitive skill assessments, and read a series of sentences as their eye-movements were monitored. Statistical analyses were performed to establish what tests of reading abilities were predictive of eye-movement patterns across this population and how strong the effects were. We found that individual scores in rapid automatized naming and word identification tests (i) were the only participant variables with reliable predictivity throughout the time-course of reading; (ii) elicited effects that superceded in magnitude the effects of established predictors like word length or frequency; and (iii) strongly modulated the influence of word length and frequency on fixation times. We discuss implications of our findings for testing reading ability, as well as for research of eye-movements in reading. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In this review, we consider methodological advances with particular relevance to the role of WM in age-related changes in processing speed.

Together with a carefully designed task protocol, we emphasize that the combined implementation of intra-individual variability and neuroimaging techniques hold promise for specifying the WM-processing speed relationship with implications for normative and clinical samples.},

Electrophysiological markers for lexical-semantic processes indicate that semantic processing of words in picture contexts is present at 14 months and for words in sentential contexts around 30 months. At 32 months, children demonstrate an adult-like electrophysiological response pattern to syntactic violations. The similarities between the brain response patterns observed in children and adults support the view that language develops in a continuous manner.},

However, computational limitations or lack of an appropriate prior sometimes prevent researchers from using exact BFs. Instead, it is approximated, often using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or a variant of BIC. The authors provide a comparison of several BF approximations, including two new approximations, the Scaled Unit Information Prior Bayesian Information Criterion (SPBIC) and Information matrix-based Bayesian Information Criterion (IBIC). The SPBIC uses a scaled unit information prior that is more general than the BIC's unit information prior, and the IBIC utilizes more terms of approximation than the BIC. Through simulation, the authors show that several measures perform well in large samples, that performance declines in smaller samples, and that SPBIC and IBIC provide improvement to existing measures under some conditions, including small sample sizes. The authors illustrate the use of the fit measures with the crime data of Ehrlich and then conclude with recommendations for researchers.},

While the goal of mathematical modeling in cognitive psychology is to select one model from a set of competing models that best captures the underlying mental process, choosing the model that best fits a particular set of data will not achieve this goal. This is because a highly complex model can provide a good fit without necessarily bearing any interpretable relationship with the underlying process. It is shown that model selection based solely on the fit to observed data will result in the choice of an unnecessarily complex model that overfits the data, and thus generalizes poorly. The effect of over-fitting must be properly offset by model selection methods. An application example of selection methods using artificial data is also presented. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

The empirical literature is reviewed with regard to the presence of slope differences and position effects. Theoretical investigations demonstrate that self-terminating models can readily predict the results often associated with exhaustive processing, but a very broad class of exhaustive models is incapable of predicting position effects and slope differences typically associated with self-termination. Because position effects and slope differences are found throughout the rapid search literature, we conclude that the exhaustive processing hypothesis is not tenable under common experimental conditions.},

abstract = {Psycholinguists are making increasing use of regression analyses and mixed-effects modeling. In an attempt to deal with concerns about collinearity, a number of researchers orthogonalize predictor variables by residualizing (i.e., by regressing one predictor onto another, and using the residuals as a stand-in for the original predictor). In the current study, the effects of residualizing predictor variables are demonstrated and discussed using ordinary least-squares regression and mixed-effects models. Some of these effects are almost certainly not what the researcher intended and are probably highly undesirable. Most importantly, what residualizing does not do is change the result for the residualized variable, which many researchers probably will find surprising. Further, some analyses with residualized variables cannot be meaningfully interpreted. Hence, residualizing is not a useful remedy for collinearity. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The electrophysiology of language comprehension has long been dominated by research on syntactic and semantic integration. However, to understand expressions like "he did it" or "the little girl", combining word meanings in accordance with semantic and syntactic constraints is not enough-readers and listeners also need to work out what or who is being referred to. We review our event-related brain potential research on the processes involved in establishing reference, and present a new experiment in which we examine when and how the implicit causality associated with specific interpersonal verbs affects the interpretation of a referentially ambiguous pronoun. The evidence suggests that upon encountering a singular noun or pronoun, readers and listeners immediately inspect their situation model for a suitable discourse entity, such that they can discriminate between having too many, too few, or exactly the right number of referents within at most half a second. Furthermore, our implicit causality findings indicate that a fragment like "David praised Linda because..." can immediately foreground a particular referent, to the extent that a subsequent "he" is at least initially construed as a syntactic error. In all, our brain potential findings suggest that referential processing is highly incremental, and not necessarily contingent upon the syntax. In addition, they demonstrate that we can use ERPs to relatively selectively keep track of how readers and listeners establish reference.},

abstract = {The present study examined the processing of the Mandarin Chinese long-distance reflexive ziji to evaluate the role that syntactic structure plays in the memory retrieval operations that support sentence comprehension. Using the multiple-response speed-accuracy tradeoff (MR-SAT) paradigm, we measured the speed with which comprehenders retrieve an antecedent for ziji. Our experimental materials contrasted sentences where ziji's antecedent was in the local clause with sentences where ziji's antecedent was in a distant clause. Time course results from MR-SAT suggest that ziji dependencies with syntactically distant antecedents are slower to process than syntactically local dependencies. To aid in interpreting the SAT data, we present a formal model of the antecedent retrieval process, and derive quantitative predictions about the time course of antecedent retrieval. The modeling results support the Local Search hypothesis: during syntactic retrieval, comprehenders initially limit memory search to the local syntactic domain. We argue that Local Search hypothesis has important implications for theories of locality effects in sentence comprehension. In particular, our results suggest that not all locality effects may be reduced to the effects of temporal decay and retrieval interference.},

A non-parametric perspective is adopted by defining a modified risk taking into account the uncertainty of the predicted outputs when missing values are involved. It is shown that this approach generalizes the approach of mean imputation in the linear case and the resulting kernel machine reduces to the standard Support Vector Machine (SVM) when no input values are missing. Furthermore, the method is extended to the multivariate case of fitting additive models using componentwise kernel machines, and an efficient implementation is based on the Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier formulation.},

abstract = {German, English, Spanish, and French versions of short (ia) and long (ib) relative clauses were tested in written questionnaire studies. The noun phrases containing the clauses appeared in either object position (as in i) or in subject/topic position, and the relative clauses ambiguously modified the first or the second noun of the noun phrase.(i).a. The doctor met the son of the colonel who died.b. The doctor met the son of the colonel who tragically died of a stroke. In the first experiment, German, English and Spanish were tested. In all three languages, more high attachment (first noun modification) interpretations were observed for long relative clauses than for short ones, perhaps reflecting differences in implicit prosodic phrasing provided by participants when they read the questionnaire. Across languages, more high attachment was observed in object position than in subject/topic position, but this effect was larger for German and Spanish than for English. In addition, although more low attachment than high attachment was observed in every case except German object position, German showed more high attachment than Spanish or English. A second questionnaire indicated that the preference for high attachment in German object position relative clauses cannot be attributed to readers taking these relative clauses to be extraposed. In a third questionnaire in French, we found a generally higher preference for high attachments as in German, but no position effect, as observed in English. We provide an account of these data, which does not require any special theory of relative clause attachment or parameterization for languages. It requires only general processing principles together with independently required grammatical differences among the languages studied involving the focus properties of object vs. non-object position and the availability in Spanish and German, but not English and French, of separate positions for topical vs. nontopical subjects.},

The theory proposes that both processing and storage are mediated by activation and that the total amount of activation available in working memory varies among individuals. Individual differences in working memory capacity for language can account for qualitative and quantitative differences among college-age adults in several aspects of language comprehension. One aspect is syntactic modularity: The larger capacity of some individuals permits interaction among syntactic and pragmatic information, so that their syntactic processes are not informationally encapsulated. Another aspect is syntactic ambiguity: The larger capacity of some individuals permits them to maintain multiple interpretations. The theory is instantiated as a production system model in which the amount of activation available to the model affects how it adapts to the transient computational and storage demands that occur in comprehension.},

Schweickert (1995, Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 39, 285-314) developed a mathematical theory for the decomposability of response time (RT) into two component times that are selectively influenced by different factors and are either stochastically independent or perfectly positively stochastically interdependent (in which case they are increasing functions of a common random variable). In this theory, RT is obtained from its component times by means of an associative and commutative operation. For any such operation, there is a decomposition test, a relationship between observable RT distributions that holds if and (under mild constraints) only if the RTs are decomposable by means of this operation. In this paper, we construct a sample-level version of these decomposition tests that serve to determine whether RTs that are represented by finite samples are decomposable by means of a given operation (under a given form of stochastic relationship between component times, independence or perfect positive interdependence). The decision is based on the asymptotic p-values associated with the maximal distance between empirical distribution functions computed by combining in a certain way the RT samples corresponding to different treatments.},

abstract = {To support the idea that temporal information processing may depend on an internal clock, Treisman et al. proposed a pacemaker model (Treisman, M., Faulkner, A., Naish, P.L.N., Brogan, D., 1990. The internal clock: Evidence for a temporal oscillator underlying time perception with some estimates of its characteristics frequency. Perception 19, 705-743.) and a technique for interfering with it by introducing an external periodic phenomenon. Experimental results obtained by these authors on time estimation and production tasks support this model. In another study, Treisman et al. established that the pacemaker also affects reaction times (RT) (Treisman, M., Faulkner, A., Naish, P.L.N., 1992. On the relation between time perception and the timing of motor action: Evidence for a temporal oscillator controlling the timing of movement. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology 45A, 235-263.). In the present study, we addressed the question as to which information processing stage (Sanders, A.F., 1980. Stage analysis of reaction process, In: Stelmach, G.E., Requin, J. (Eds.). Tutorials in motor behavior. North-Holland, Amsterdam, pp. 331-354.) is affected by this internal clock. For this purpose, we used the Additive Factors Method (Sternberg, S., 1969. The discovery of processing stages: Extension of Donder's method. In: Koster, W.G. (Ed.). Attention and Performance II. Acta Psychologica 30, 276-315.). To vary sensorial processing time, we used two visual stimulus intensities. Stimulus-response mapping was manipulated to enhance central processing time. To modify the duration of the motor stages, the two responses could be given by two fingers on the same hand (right ring vs. middle finger) or by two fingers of the different hands (right ring vs. left middle finger). Intensity of the stimulus, stimulus-response mapping, and repertoire of responses were found to be additive. We obtained RT modulations similar to those obtained by Treisman et al. in 1992. No first order interactions were observed between the periodical phenomenon and the other manipulated factors but only a third order one. Two possible interpretations of these results are proposed.},

abstract = {Newly discovered true (non-null) associations often have inflated effects compared with the true effect sizes. I discuss here the main reasons for this inflation. First, theoretical considerations prove that when true discovery is claimed based on crossing a threshold of statistical significance and the discovery study is underpowered, the observed effects are expected to be inflated. This has been demonstrated in various fields ranging from early stopped clinical trials to genome-wide associations. Second, flexible analyses coupled with selective reporting may inflate the published discovered effects. The vibration ratio (the ratio of the largest vs. smallest effect on the same association approached with different analytic choices) can be very large. Third, effects may be inflated at the stage of interpretation due to diverse conflicts of interest. Discovered effects are not always inflated, and under some circumstances may be deflated-for example, in the setting of late discovery of associations in sequentially accumulated overpowered evidence, in some types of misclassification from measurement error, and in conflicts causing reverse biases. Finally, I discuss potential approaches to this problem. These include being cautious about newly discovered effect sizes, considering some rational down-adjustment, using analytical methods that correct for the anticipated inflation, ignoring the magnitude of the effect (if not necessary), conducting large studies in the discovery phase, using strict protocols for analyses, pursuing complete and transparent reporting of all results, placing emphasis on replication, and being fair with interpretation of results.},

As a consequence, students struggle to learn new statistical analyses, in contexts that differ from their textbooks. This paper gives a short introduction to the general linear model (GLM), in which it is showed that ANOVA (one‐way, factorial, repeated measure and analysis of covariance) is simply a multiple correlation/regression analysis (MCRA). Generalizations to other cases, such as multivariate and nonlinear analysis, are also discussed. It can easily be shown that every popular linear analysis can be derived from understanding MCRA},

abstract = {Studies of syntactic ambiguity resolution have played a central role in resolving questions about when and how contextual information affects parsing processes. These investigations are often couched in terms of modularity versus interaction, with demonstrations of rapid contextual effects being taken as evidence that the mechanisms responsible for structuring sentences are permeable to referential or semantic context, and therefore non-modular. In this paper, we will propose that argument relations are constructed on the basis of lexically stored syntactic representations (as in MacDonald, M.C., Pearlmutter, N.J., and Seidenberg, M.S. (1994). Lexical nature of syntactic ambiguity resolution. Psychological Review, 101, 676-703. Pickering, M.J., and Traxler, M.J. (2004). Grammatical repetition and garden path effects.

Traxler, M.J., and Pickering, M.J. (2005, March). Syntactic priming in comprehension. Paper presented to the CUNY Sentence Processing Conference. Tucson, AZ), but that other types of structural decisions are made on the basis of general processing principles. This formulation can be tested by looking at how the parser reacts to immediate intra- and inter-sentential factors (short-term context) and how it reacts to patterns of input over longer time scales (long-term context). We begin with a brief review of work on context effects in syntactic disambiguation, sketch our account of parsing, and then provide evidence from two eye-tracking experiments that illustrate some of the processing principles that govern parsing of argument relations. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {This target article discusses the verbal working memory system used in sentence comprehension. We review the idea of working memory as a short duration system in which small amounts of information are simultaneously stored and manipulated in the service of a task and that syntactic processing in sentence comprehension requires such a storage and computational system. We inquire whether the working memory system used in syntactic processing is the same as that used in verbally mediated tasks involving conscious, controlled processing. Various forms of evidence are considered: the relationship between individual differences in working memory and individual differences in the efficiency of syntactic processing; the effect of concurrent verbal memory load on syntactic processing; and syntactic processing in patients with poor short term memory, poor working memory, or aphasia. The experimental results suggest that the verbal working memory system specialized for assigning the syntactic structure of a sentence and for using that structure in determining sentence meaning is distinct from the working memory system that underlies the use of sentence meaning to accomplish further functions. We present a theory of the components of the verbal working memory system and suggestions as to its neural basis.},

abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

abstract = {Unlike molecules or plots of barley, subjects in psycholinguistic experiments are intelligent beings that depend for their survival on constant adaptation to their environment. This study presents three data sets documenting the presence of adaptive processes in psychological experiments. These adaptive processes leave a statistical footprint in the form of autocorrelations in the residual error associated with by-subject time series of trial-to-trial responses. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) provide a unified framework within which both factorial predictors and covariates given with the experimental design, as well as non-linear random effects and interactions with experimental time can be uncovered and evaluated. GAMMs not only provide substantially improved fits to experimental data with time series structure, but also provide improved insight into predictors of theoretical interest, as well as a more refined window on the random effects structure. Our results challenge the standard advocated by Barr et al. (2013). The analytical cage of the maximal linear mixed model to which this standard confines the analyst is motivated by simulation studies which presuppose experimental data to be sterile, and free of any adaptive processes. However, when adaptive processes are present in real data, the simulation results of Barr et al. are no longer informative. For such data, the method of analysis cannot be purely design-driven, but must be in part driven by the data.},

abstract = {When people read temporarily ambiguous sentences, there is often an increased prevalence of regressive eye-movements launched from the word that resolves the ambiguity. Traditionally, such regressions have been interpreted at least in part as reflecting readers' efforts to re-read and reconfigure earlier material, as exemplified by the Selective Reanalysis hypothesis [Frazier, L., {\&} Rayner, K. (1982). Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences. Cognitive Psychology, 14, 178-210]. Within such frameworks it is assumed that the selection of saccadic landing-sites is linguistically supervised. As an alternative to this proposal, we consider the possibility (dubbed the Time Out hypothesis) that regression control is partly decoupled from linguistic operations and that landing-sites are instead selected on the basis of low-level spatial properties such as their proximity to the point from which the regressive saccade was launched. Two eye-tracking experiments were conducted to compare the explanatory potential of these two accounts. Experiment 1 manipulated the formatting of linguistically identical sentences and showed, contrary to purely linguistic supervision, that the landing site of the first regression from a critical word was reliably influenced by the physical layout of the text. Experiment 2 used a fixed physical format but manipulated the position in the display at which reanalysis-relevant material was located. Here the results showed a highly reliable linguistic influence on the overall distribution of regression landing sites (though with few effects being apparent on the very first regression). These results are interpreted as reflecting mutually exclusive forms of regression control with fixation sequences being influenced both by spatially constrained, partially decoupled supervision systems as well as by some kind of linguistic guidance. The findings are discussed in relation to existing computational models of eye-movements in reading. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We propose that NAI content expresses a complete speech act distinct from the speech act of the containing utterance. The speech act hypothesis leads us to expect the semantic properties Potts established. We present experimental confirmation of two intuitive observations made by Potts: first that speech act adverbs should be acceptable as NAI content, supporting the speech act hypothesis; and second, that when two speech acts are expressed as successive sentences, the comprehender assumes they are related by some discourse coherence relation, whereas an NAI speech act need not bear a restrictive discourse coherence relation to its containing utterance, though overall sentences containing relevant content are rated more acceptable than those that do not. The speech act hypothesis accounts for these effects, and further accounts for why judgments of syntactic complexity or evaluations of whether or not a statement is true interact with the at-issue status of the material being judged or evaluated.},

This paper investigates whether the processing of Mandarin wh-in-situ questions indeed involves constructing a long-distance dependency. Using the multiple-response speed-accuracy (SAT) paradigm. We show that Chinese wh-in-situ quesitons incur more processing costs compared to their non-wh counterparts. Furthermore, the length of the covert dependency only affected the processing accuracy, but not the processing speed, suggesting a content-addressable memory process underlying the construction of wh-in-situ dependencies, similar to overt long distance dependencies in English.},

abstract = {The cognitive concept of response inhibition can be measured with the stop-signal paradigm. In this paradigm, participants perform a 2-choice response time (RT) task where, on some of the trials, the primary task is interrupted by a stop signal that prompts participants to withhold their response. The dependent variable of interest is the latency of the unobservable stop response (stop-signal reaction time, or SSRT). Based on the horse race model (Logan {\&} Cowan, 1984), several methods have been developed to estimate SSRTs. None of these approaches allow for the accurate estimation of the entire distribution of SSRTs. Here we introduce a Bayesian parametric approach that addresses this limitation. Our method is based on the assumptions of the horse race model and rests on the concept of censored distributions. We treat response inhibition as a censoring mechanism, where the distribution of RTs on the primary task (go RTs) is censored by the distribution of SSRTs. The method assumes that go RTs and SSRTs are ex-Gaussian distributed and uses Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to obtain posterior distributions for the model parameters. The method can be applied to individual as well as hierarchical data structures. We present the results of a number of parameter recovery and robustness studies and apply our approach to published data from a stop-signal experiment.},

abstract = {A fundamental distinction in tasks of memory search is whether items receive varied mappings (targets and distractors switch roles across trials) or consistent mappings (targets and distractors never switch roles). The type of mapping often produces markedly different performance patterns, but formal memory-based models that account quantitatively for detailed aspects of the results have not yet been developed and evaluated. Experiments were conducted to test a modern exemplar-retrieval model on its ability to account for memory-search performance involving a wide range of memory-set sizes in both varied-mapping (VM) and consistent-mapping (CM) probe-recognition tasks. The model formalized the idea that both familiarity-based and categorization-based processes operate. The model was required to fit detailed response-time (RT) distributions of individual, highly practiced subjects. A key manipulation involved the repetition of negative probes across trials. This manipulation produced a dramatic dissociation: False-alarm rates increased and correct-rejection RTs got longer in VM, but not in CM. The qualitative pattern of results and modeling analyses provided evidence for a strong form of categorization-based processing in CM, in which observers made use of the membership of negative probes in the "new" category to make old-new recognition decisions.},

abstract = {The introduction of the psychophysical technique of MAGNITUDE ESTIMATION to the study of acceptability judgments (Bard et al. 1996) has led to a surge of interest in formal acceptability judgment experiments over the past fifteen years. One of the primary reasons for its popularity is that it was developed as a tool to measure actual units of perception, offering the possibility of data that is inherently more informative than previous scaling tasks. However, there are several untested cognitive assumptions that must hold in order for ME to be the perceptual measurement test that it is purported to be. Building on the recent formalization of these assumptions in the psychophysics literature (Narens 1996, Luce 2002), this article presents two experiments designed to test whether these assumptions hold for acceptability-judgment experiments. The results suggest that the cognitive assumptions of magnitude estimation do not hold for participants in acceptability-judgment experiments, eliminating any reason to believe that ME could deliver inherently more meaningful data than other acceptability-judgment tasks.},

abstract = {Current modeling of response times on test items has been strongly influenced by the paradigm of experimental reaction-time research in psychology. For instance, some of the models have a parameter structure that was chosen to represent a speed-accuracy tradeoff, while others equate speed directly with response time. Also, several response-time models seem to be unclear as to the level of parametrization they represent. A hierarchical framework for modeling speed and accuracy on test items is presented as an alternative to these models. The framework allows a plug-and-play approach with alternative choices of models for the response and response-time distributions as well as the distributions of their parameters. Bayesian treatment of the framework with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) computation facilitates the approach. Use of the framework is illustrated for the choice of a normal-ogive response model, a lognormal model for the response times, and multivariate normal models for their parameters with Gibbs sampling from the joint posterior distribution.},

abstract = {We report three eye-movement experiments and an antecedent choice task investigating the interpretation of reflexives in different syntactic contexts. This included contexts in which the reflexive and a local antecedent were coarguments of the same verbal predicate (John heard that the soldier had injured himself), and also so-called picture noun phrases, either with a possessor (John heard about the soldier's picture of himself) or without (John heard that the soldier had a picture of himself). While results from the antecedent choice task indicated that comprehenders would choose a nonlocal antecedent ('John' above) for reflexives in either type of picture noun phrase, the eye-movement experiments suggested that participants preferred to initially interpret the reflexive in each context as referring to the local antecedent ('the soldier'), as indexed by longer reading times when it mismatched in gender with the reflexive. We also observed a difference in the time-course of this effect. While it was observed during first-pass processing at the reflexive for coargument reflexives and those in picture noun phrases with a possessor, it was comparatively delayed for reflexives in possessorless picture noun phrases. These results suggest that locality constraints are more strongly weighted cues to retrieval than gender agreement for both coargument reflexives and those inside picture noun phrases. We interpret the observed time-course differences as indexing the relative ease of accessing the local antecedent in different syntactic contexts. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Bever distinguishes three aspects of cognition and how they affect language development:  basic capacities, behavioral strategies, and cognitive structures.  He suggests particular behavioral strategies in discussing how clauses are isolated and assigned internal structure in speech perception. Bever reports an experiment in which children, ages 2:0-4:11, used toys to act out reversible,  probable, and improbable active and passive sentences. By age 3 children seem to use a processing strategy (strategy C) by which 'Constituents are functionally related internally according to semantic constraints,' resulting in reversed interpretations of improbable sentences like 'The dog pats the mother.'At about age 4 children briefly adopt a surface word order strategy for reversible (neutral) sentences, (strategy D) a NVN sequence within a potential internal unit in the surface structure corresponds to `actor-action-object.' Within a few months, performance improves dramatically on reversible sentences but slowly on improbable sentences.

abstract = {(from the chapter) This article provides an overview of studies of priming in language comprehension. The original definition of priming has expanded from the seminal studies by Meyer and Schvaneveldt (1971), but we will use the original sense of priming as the facilitation of a response to a target stimulus based on prior presentation of another stimulus. Priming studies have been used to investigate a wide variety of phenomena - everything from implicit memory systems (Roediger et al., 1992) to face recognition (Wiese and Schweinberger, 2010) to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (Ehring and Ehlers, 2010) to psychic abilities (Bern, 2011). This review will focus on the use of priming methods to investigate linguistic representations and processes, as studies of priming effects have played a central role in development of a variety of psycholinguistic theories. This review will emphasize how priming studies have influenced the development of accounts of semantic memory, lexical representation and processing, and syntactic representation and parsing.

abstract = {Many experiments have shown that listeners actively build expectations about up-coming words, rather than simply waiting for information to accumulate. The online construction of a syntactic structure is one of the cues that listeners may use to construct strong expectations about the possible words they will be exposed to. For example, speakers of verb-final languages use pre-verbal arguments to predict on-line the kind of arguments that are likely to occur next (e.g., Kamide, 2008, for a review). Although in SVO languages information about a verb's arguments typically follows the verb, some languages use pre-verbal object pronouns, potentially allowing listeners to build on-line expectations about the nature of the upcoming verb. For instance, if a pre-verbal direct object pronoun is heard, then the following verb has to be able to enter a transitive structure, thus excluding intransitive verbs. To test this, we used French, in which object pronouns have to appear pre-verbally, to investigate whether listeners use this cue to predict the occurrence of a transitive verb. In a word detection task, we measured the number of false alarms to sentences that contained a transitive verb whose first syllable was homophonous to the target monosyllabic verb (e.g., target "dort" /dɔʁ/ to sleep and false alarm verb "dorlote" /dɔʁlɔt/ to cuddle). The crucial comparison involved two sentence types, one without a pre-verbal object clitic, for which an intransitive verb was temporarily a plausible option (e.g., "Il dorlote" / He cuddles) and the other with a pre-verbal object clitic, that made the appearance of an intransitive verb impossible ("Il le dorlote" / He cuddles it). Results showed a lower rate of false alarms for sentences with a pre-verbal object pronoun (3{\%}) compared to locally ambiguous sentences (about 20{\%}). Participants rapidly incorporate information about a verb's argument structure to constrain lexical access to verbs that match the expected subcategorization frame.},

abstract = {In two experiments, we tested whether individual differences in strategy production account for individual differences in performance on a working memory span task. We measured the strategies used during a standard experimenter-paced operation span (OSPAN) task by having participants make both set-by-set reports of strategy use for individual item sets and global reports of strategy use. In Experiment 1, although normatively effective strategies were self-reported on only a small proportion of OSPAN sets, individual differences in effective strategy use correlated with span performance. Experiment 2 replicated this outcome using a sample of 100 participants but, as important, it demonstrated that individual differences in effective strategy use did not mediate the relationship between OSPAN and measures of verbal ability. Discussion focuses on the interpretation of strategy-span relationships and the relative utility of general reports of strategy use versus the set-by-set reports introduced here for the OSPAN task.},

- does strategy-use account for differences in ospan?
{\textgreater} although normatively effective strategies were self-reported on only a small proportion of OSPAN sets, individual differences in effective strategy use correlated with span per- formance
{\textgreater} individual differences in effective strategy use did not mediate the relationship between OSPAN and measures of verbal ability


intro
- Hasher and colleagues argue that individual differences in span reflect the degree to which people inhibit irrelevant, or no-longer-relevant, information from WM when performing the task (e.g., Lustig, May, {\{}{\&}{\}} Hasher, 2001; May, Hasher, {\{}{\&}{\}} Kane, 1999)
- Engle and his colleagues suggest that variability in span performance derives from indi- vidual differences in attention control capabilities that are critical to both active maintenance and inhibition
- all emphasize that WM capacity differences---as measured by WM span---largely reflect the integrity of general pro- cesses or mechanisms that are central to the WM system (Conway, Kane, {\{}{\&}{\}} Engle, 2003).
- examine third theory: individual differences that arise in WM span are readily explained in terms of variability in some relatively general mechanism but, in principle, they can be equally well accounted for by differences in strategic behaviour
- differences in span performance are assumed to result from variability in the algorithms, or strategies, that individuals use while performing span tasks
- strategy instructions (turly-ames {\{}{\&}{\}} whitfield 2003), as well as more intensive training in the use of a particular strategy (McNamara {\{}{\&}{\}} Scott, 2001), significantly boosted span scores
- engle, cantor {\{}{\&}{\}} carullo (1992) and friedman {\{}{\&}{\}} miyake (2004): Viewing time on the to-be-remembered words correlated significantly with span performance (r 1⁄4 .29), suggesting that high-WM individuals read (or studied, or rehearsed) the target words for more time than did low-WM individuals


the study
- rather than allowing participants to pace themselves through the task, in our studies (as in most) the experimenter controlled the stimulus presentation
- participants who used the imagery-based strategy earned higher span scores than did those who did not in friedman {\{}{\&}{\}} miyake (2004)
- set-by-set: after each set question for strategy (exp. 1)
- retrospective: first all sets, then question for each set (exp. 1 and 2)
- set-by-set reliable and without influence on performance and/or strategy-use in the task
- set-by-set reports demonstrate acceptable validity and have minimal reactive effects on task processing when they are used to measure strategy use in related domains, such as in associative learning and free recall
- If strategy use accounts for individual differ- ences in span performance, then the correlation between the use of effective strategies and span performance will be positive.


exp 1
- two groups: retro. and set-by-set and retro-only
- to achieve greater statistical power for analyses relevant to the strategy mediation hypothesis, we collapsed across the two groups and analysed retrospective reports where appropriate
- first general report without suggestions, then set-by-set retrospective
- The OSPAN task was scored by calculating the percentage of items in each set that were recalled in correct serial position and then averaging these percentages across sets (PCU)
- mostly just reading the word, effective strategy on over 20{\%}, less effective on {\~{}}33{\%}
- 30{\%} only reading or rehearsing, only 63{\%} at least one effective strategy
- "Thus, although indi- viduals were strategic in some cases, widespread use of normatively effective strategies was not evident, with close to 70{\%} of the participants using them on fewer than a third of the trials."
- Given that retrospective reports could not have reactive effects on the OSPAN task (because they occurred after the OSPAN task had been performed), we used them exclusively in Experiment 2.
- as expected, span performance was higher when participants reported using mediational strategies that involved associating the to-be-remembered words within a set than when they just read the words or used more passive rehearsal strategies.
- general reports: span performance was not consistently greater across groups when participants reported that they had used a more effective strategy than a less effective one
- if all we had available were these general reports, we would conclude that participants' strategies in OSPAN had no relation to their performance!!!
- strategy reports significantly predicted OSPAN scores, such that trials on which participants reported using a normatively effective strategy yielded higher recall than did trials on which participants reported using a normatively ineffective strategy


exp. 2
- replicate findings and to allow more complete evaluation of strategy mediation hypothesis
- concurrent set-by-set reports were dropped in favour of retrospective reports
- to investigate whether strategy use can account for any span-- ability relationships, each participant also com- pleted three standard measures of cognitive (verbal) ability, which included tests of analogical reasoning and reading comprehension.
- Verbal Analogies, Reading Comprehension, and Inference); the first two were modified from the originals by presenting only a subset of items
- The major meth- odological change was that all set-by-set reports were made retrospectively.
- set-by-set reports had construct validity, accounted for varia- bility in span performance, and were more highly related to span performance than were general reports
- 24{\%} only rehearsal/reading, 71{\%} at least one effective strategy
- although individ- uals were strategic in some cases, widespread use of effective strategies was not evident, with over 50{\%} of the participants using them on fewer than a third of the trials.
- The proportion correct on the span task was significantly greater for normatively effective strategies (M 1⁄4 .70, Mdn 1⁄4 .73, SEM 1⁄4 .03) than for the normatively less effective strategies (M 1⁄4 .61, Mdn 1⁄4 .62, SEM 1⁄4 .02), t(67) 1⁄4 2.90, p , .05.
- several diverse sources of evidence demonstrate the empirical validity of the strategy-as-effect account


Across two experiments, individual differences in effective strategy use were evident. As important, these differences sig- nificantly correlated with performance on the span task. These outcomes confirm a critical prediction of the strategy mediation hypothesis.


Turley-Ames and Whitfield (2003) found that high-WM participants benefited little when instructed to use rehearsal, imagery, or semantic-chaining strategies during OSPAN, because they appeared to have been performing optimally in the pretest, prior to any instruction.


individual differences in WM capacity may afford the use of strategies, which in turn can contribute to span scores},

In the present study, we used the gaze-contingent boundary paradigm (Rayner, 1975) to manipulate the preview for a two-word target region (e.g. white walls in My neighbor painted the white walls black). Readers received an identical (white walls), transposed (walls white), or unrelated preview (vodka clubs). We found that there was a clear cost of having a transposed preview compared to an identical preview, indicating that readers cannot or do not identify words out of order. However, on some measures, the transposed preview condition did lead to faster processing than the unrelated preview condition, suggesting that readers may be able to obtain some useful information from a transposed preview. Implications of the results for models of eye movement control in reading are discussed.},

abstract = {Accounts of comprehension failure, whether in the case of readers with poor skill or when syntactic complexity is high, have overwhelmingly implicated working memory capacity as the key causal factor. However, extant research suggests that this position is not well supported by evidence on the span of active memory during online sentence processing, nor is it well motivated by models that make explicit claims about the memory mechanisms that support language processing. The current study suggests that sensitivity to interference from similar items in memory may provide a better explanation of comprehension failure. Through administration of a comprehensive skill battery, we found that the previously observed association of working memory with comprehension is likely due to the collinearity of working memory with many other reading-related skills, especially IQ. In analyses which removed variance shared with IQ, we found that receptive vocabulary knowledge was the only significant predictor of comprehension performance in our task out of a battery of 24 skill measures. In addition, receptive vocabulary and non-verbal memory for serial order-but not simple verbal memory or working memory-were the only predictors of reading times in the region where interference had its primary affect. We interpret these results in light of a model that emphasizes retrieval interference and the quality of lexical representations as key determinants of successful comprehension. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The function of microsaccades is controversial, largely because the neural mechanisms responsible for their generation are unknown. Here, we show that the superior colliculus (SC), a retinotopically organized structure involved in voluntary-saccade target selection, plays a causal role in microsaccade generation. Neurons in the foveal portion of the SC increase their activity before and during microsaccades with sizes of only a few minutes of arc and exhibit selectivity for the direction and amplitude of these movements. Reversible inactivation of these neurons significantly reduces microsaccade rate without otherwise compromising fixation. These results, coupled with computational modeling of SC activity, demonstrate that microsaccades are controlled by the SC and explain the link between microsaccades and visual attention.},

For successful cross-situational learning, people must approximately track which words and referents co-occur most frequently. This study investigates the effects of allowing some word-referent pairs to appear more frequently than others, as is true in real-world learning environments. Surprisingly, high-frequency pairs are not always learned better, but can also boost learning of other pairs. Using a recent associative model (Kachergis, Yu, {\&} Shiffrin, 2012), we explain how mixing pairs of different frequencies can bootstrap late learning of the low-frequency pairs based on early learning of higher frequency pairs. We also manipulate contextual diversity, the number of pairs a given pair appears with across training, since it is naturalistically confounded with frequency. The associative model has competing familiarity and uncertainty biases, and their interaction is able to capture the individual and combined effects of frequency and contextual diversity on human learning. Two other recent word-learning models do not account for the behavioral findings.},

abstract = {Previous research reported that in processing structurally ambiguous sentences comprehenders often preserve an initial incorrect analysis even after adopting a correct analysis following structural disambiguation. One criticism is that the sentences tested in previous studies involved referential ambiguity and allowed comprehenders to make inferences about the initial interpretation using pragmatic information, suggesting the possibility that the initial analysis persisted due to comprehenders' pragmatic inference but not to their failure to perform complete reanalysis of the initial misanalysis. Our study investigated this by testing locally ambiguous relative clause sentences in Japanese, in which the initial misinterpretation contradicts the correct interpretation. Our study using a self-paced reading technique demonstrated evidence for the persistence of the initial analysis with this structure. The results from an eye-tracking study further suggested that the phenomenon directly reflected the amount of support given to the initial incorrect analysis prior to disambiguating information: The more supported the incorrect main clause analysis was, the more likely comprehenders were to preserve the analysis even after the analysis was falsified. Our results thus demonstrated that the preservation of the initial analysis occurs not due to referential ambiguities but to comprehenders' difficulty to fully revise the highly supported initial interpretation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Psychonomic Society, Inc. Our lab recently found evidence that efficient visual search (with a fixed target) is characterized by logarithmic Reaction Time (RT) × Set Size functions whose steepness is modulated by the similarity between target and distractors. To determine whether this pattern of results was based on low-level visual factors uncontrolled by previous experiments, we minimized the possibility of crowding effects in the display, compensated for the cortical magnification factor by magnifying search items based on their eccentricity, and compared search performance on such displays to performance on displays without magnification compensation. In both cases, the RT × Set Size functions were found to be logarithmic, and the modulation of the log slopes by target–distractor similarity was replicated. Consistent with previous results in the literature, cortical magnification compensation eliminated most target eccentricity effects. We conclude that the log functions and their modulation by target–distractor similarity relations reflect a parallel exhaustive processing architecture for early vision.},

If human language comprehension is a rational process in the sense of making use of all available infor-mation sources, then we might expect uncer-tainty at the level of word-level input to af-fect sentence-level comprehension. However, nearly all contemporary models of sentence comprehension assume clean input—that is, that the input to the sentence-level com-prehension mechanism is a perfectly-formed, completely certain sequence of input tokens (words). This article presents a simple model of rational human sentence comprehension under noisy input, and uses the model to in-vestigate some outstanding problems in the psycholinguistic literature for theories of ra-tional human sentence comprehension. We argue that by explicitly accounting for input-level noise in sentence processing, our model provides solutions for these outstanding prob-lems and broadens the scope of theories of hu-man sentence comprehension as rational prob-abilistic inference.},

abstract = {Statistical mimicking issues involving reaction time measures are introduced and discussed in this article. Often, discussions of mimicking have concerned the question of the serial versus parallel processing of inputs to the cognitive system. We will demonstrate that there are several alternative structures that mimic various existing models in the literature. In particular, single-process models have been neglected in this area. When parameter variability is incorporated into single-process models, resulting in discrete or continuous mixtures of reaction time distributions, the observed reaction time distribution alone is no longer as useful in allowing inferences to be made about the architecture of the process that produced it. Many of the issues are raised explicitly in examination of four different case studies of mimicking. Rather than casting a shadow over the use of quantitative methods in testing models of cognitive processes, these examples emphasize the importance of examining reaction time data armed with the tools of quantitative analysis, the importance of collecting data from the context of specific process models, and the importance of expanding the database to include other dependent measures.},

abstract = {Two eye movement experiments explored the roles of verbal subcategorization possibilities and transitivity biases in the processing of heavy NP shift sentences in which the verb's direct object appears to the right of a post-verbal phrase. In Experiment 1, participants read sentences in which a prepositional phrase immediately followed the verb, which was either obligatorily transitive or had a high transitivity bias (e.g., Jack praised/watched from the stands his daughter's attempt to shoot a basket). Experiment 2 compared unshifted sentences to sentences in which an adverb intervened between the verb and its object, and obligatorily transitive verbs to optionally transitive verbs with widely varying transitivity biases. In both experiments, evidence of processing difficulty appeared on the material that intervened between the verb and its object when the verb was obligatorily transitive, and on the shifted direct object when the verb was optionally transitive, regardless of transitivity bias. We conclude that the parser adopts the heavy NP shift analysis only when it is forced to by the grammar, which we interpret in terms of a preference for immediate incremental interpretation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Traxler, Pickering, and Clifton (1998) found that ambiguous sentences are read faster than their unambiguous counterparts. This so-called ambiguity advantage has presented a major challenge to classical theories of human sentence comprehension (parsing) because its most prominent explana- tion, in the form of the unrestricted race model (URM), assumes that parsing is non-deterministic. Recently, Swets, Desmet, Clifton, and Ferreira (2008) have challenged the URM. They argue that readers strategically underspecify the representation of ambiguous sentences to save time, unless disambiguation is required by task demands. When disambiguation is required, however, readers assign sentences full structure—and Swets et al. provide experimental evidence to this end. On the basis of their findings, they argue against the URM and in favor of a model of task-dependent sentence comprehension. We show through simulations that the Swets et al. data do not constitute evidence for task-dependent parsing because they can be explained by the URM. However, we provide decisive evidence from a German self-paced reading study consistent with Swets et al.'s general claim about task-dependent parsing. Specifically, we show that under certain conditions, ambiguous sentences can be read more slowly than their unambiguous counterparts, suggesting that the parser may create several parses, when required. Finally, we present the first quantitative model of task-driven disambiguation that subsumes the URM, and we show that it can explain both Swets et al.'s results and our finding},

Data from Italian, and other languages allowing Pseudo-Relatives, support this hypothesis. Pseudo-Relative availability, however, covaries with the semantics of the main predicate (e.g., perceptual vs. stative). Experiment 1 assesses whether this predicate distinction alone can account for prior attachment results by testing it with a language that disallows Pseudo-Relatives (i.e. English). Low Attachment was found independent of Predicate-Type. Predicate-Type did however have a minor modulatory role. Experiment 2 shows that English, traditionally classified as a Low Attachment language, can demonstrate High Attachment with sentences globally ambiguous between a Small-Clause and a reduced Relative-Clause interpretation. These results support a grammatical account of previous effects and provide novel evidence for the parser's preference of a Small-Clause over a Restrictive interpretation, crosslinguistically.},

abstract = {In the field of psychology, the practice of p value null-hypothesis testing is as widespread as ever. Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of the p value procedure. In particular, p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover, p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews these p value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to these p value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

abstract = {Relative clauses (RCs) in Chinese are prenominal. In object-modifying, object-extracted RCs (e.g. Click on [RC the ball broke] window, meaning 'Click on the window [RC that the ball broke]), the ambiguous status of the local noun ball and the long-distance attachment of the head noun window into the main verb appear to make online parsing of Chinese RCs particularly difficult. By interposing mismatching classifiers and the passive marker BEI into the RC sentences, we investigated whether the presence of incomplete heads would add storage costs, as predicted by the Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), or would serve as retrieval cues to help pre-build the RC structure, as predicted by the cue-based retrieval theory. Results from a visual world eye-tracking experiment and a self-paced reading showed that Chinese comprehenders are able to use BEI cues and the mismatching classifier (albeit to a less extent) to pre-build RC structure, providing support for the cue-based retrieval theory.

The aim of this study is to investigate the way native speakers of Turkish resolve relative clause (RC) attachment ambiguities in sentences which contain a relative clause followed by a complex noun phrase with two potential attachment sites. The structures under investigation are relative clauses followed by complex NPs with genitive constructions [NP1 GEN +NP2] as in (1) and relative clauses followed by complex NPs containing postpositional phrases [[NP1 P] PP +NP2] as in (2): (1) ABD'de ya∑ayan akt{\"{o}}r{\"{u}}n o{\textcopyright}lu d{\"{u}}n u{\c{c}}ak kazası ge{\c{c}}irdi, (2) Elinde {\c{c}}i{\c{c}}ek olan g{\"{o}}revlinin yanındaki adam benim fizik {\"{o}}{\textcopyright}retmenim. Previously conducted studies have found cross-linguistic differences in the resolution of such structural ambiguities, showing that in some languages the RC is predominantly attached to the first NP, i.e. akt{\"{o}}r, while speakers of other languages attach the RC to the second NP, i.e. o{\textcopyright}lu. However, it has also been found that lexical-semantic information like the presence of a pre-/postposition in the complex NP as in (2) and the animacy features of the potential hosts constitute determining factors in the choice of the NP which the RC will be attached to. The results of two off-line (untimed) questionnaire experiments conducted with adult native speakers of Turkish reveal that sentence comprehension and (RC) ambiguity resolution is highly influenced by the semantic features of the constituents involved and speak against a parsing account for Turkish based on syntactic or locality-based constraints alone.},

In such models, the first passage time for the diffusion process through a response criterion determines the time at which an observer makes a decision about the identity of a stimulus. Because the assumptions of many cognitive models lead to SDEs that are time inhomogeneous, classical methods for solving such first passage time problems are usually inapplicable. In contrast, recent integral equation methods often yield solutions to both the one-sided and the two-sided first passage time problems, even in the presence of time inhomogeneity. These methods, which are of particular relevance to the cognitive modeler, are described in detail, together with illustrative applications. Copyright 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {We propose that, for the human parser, recovery from garden paths
consists in repairing the structure built so far, rather than reparsing
the input. The difficulty of a repair is attributable not to the
cost of effecting the structural alterations but to the cost of deducing
which alterations are needed. The parser must diagnose its error
in order to correct it. The error is signaled by an input word that
is incompatible with the current structure; this is the symptom from
which the diagnosis must be made. If the error is transparently clear
from the nature of the symptom, recovery is easy; but sometimes the
necessary reasoning is obscure, and then the diagnosis is unsuccessful
and the garden path persists. Unlike other repair models, the diagnosis
model needs no special mechanism for revising garden path analyses.
The garden path recovery device is the same machine as the first-pass
parser, merely set into emergency mode. When faced with a breakdown
the parser does not stop its normal activities and enter a new mode
of reasoning to detect what went wrong. It simply continues to parse,
attaching the problematic input item in the least ungrammatical way
it can, despite the conflict with previously built structure. This
conflict is productive; it provokes adjustments to the existing structure.
In successful cases, one adjustment leads to another until a stable
state is reached, at which point the original error will have been
eliminated. Examples suggest that the parser gives more weight to
syntatctic than to pragmatic acceptability; only a syntactic clash
between the input and the existing structure sets the adjustment
process in motion.ER -},

This chapter reviews some of the history of the method's use as well as some recent developments. It provides an extensive review of what eye movement measurement has told us about the syntactic processing of sentences, covering topics such as syntactic ambiguity, syntactic ambiguity resolution, retrieval from memory, syntactic prediction, and syntactic complexity. Alternative models for how syntactic and extra-syntactic infor-mation sources are integrated are discussed. The chapter then turns to a discussion of what the eyes actually do in response to syntactic processing complexity, and provides a brief review of models of eye movement control. It concludes by comparing eye movement measurement with other methods of measuring online sentence comprehension processes.},

abstract = {When one nerve cell acts on another, its postsynaptic effect can vary
greatly. In sensory systems, inputs from "drivers" can be differentiated
from those of "modulators." The driver can be identified as the transmitter
of receptive field properties; the modulator can be identified as
altering the probability of certain aspects of that transmission.
Where receptive fields are not available, the distinction is more
difficult and currently is undefined. We use the visual pathways,
particularly the thalamic geniculate relay for which much relevant
evidence is available, to explore ways in which drivers can be distinguished
from modulators. The extent to which the distinction may apply first
to other parts of the thalamus and then, possibly, to other parts
of the brain is considered. We suggest the following distinctions:
Cross-correlograms from driver inputs have sharper peaks than those
from modulators; there are likely to be few drivers but many modulators
for any one cell; and drivers are likely to act only through ionotropic
receptors having a fast postsynaptic effect whereas modulators also
are likely to activate metabotropic receptors having a slow and prolonged
postsynaptic effect.},

abstract = {Structural reanalysis is generally assumed to be representation-preserving, whereby the initial analysis is manipulated or repaired to arrive at a new structure. This paper contends that the theoretical and empirical basis for such approaches is weak. A conceptually simpler alternative is that the processor reprocesses (some portion of) the input using just those structure-building operations available in first-pass parsing. This reprocessing is a necessary component of any realistic processing model. By contrast, the structural revisions required for second-pass repair are more powerful than warranted by the abilities of the first-pass parser. This paper also reviews experimental evidence for repair presented by Sturt, Pickering, and Crocker (1999). We demonstrate that the Sturt et. al. findings are consistent with a reprocessing account and present a self-paced reading experiment intended to tease apart the repair and reprocessing accounts. The results support a reprocessing interpretation of Sturt et. al.'s data, rendering a repair-based explanation superfluous.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the most widely used method of estimating joint posterior distributions in Bayesian analysis. The idea of MCMC is to iteratively produce parameter values that are representative samples from the joint posterior. Unlike frequentist analysis where iterative model fitting routines are monitored for convergence to a single point, MCMC output is monitored for convergence to a distribution. Thus, specialized diagnostic tools are needed in the Bayesian setting. To this end, the R package boa was created. This manuscript presents the user's manual for boa, which outlines the use of and methodology upon which the software is based. Included is a description of the menu system, data management capabilities, and statistical/graphical methods for convergence assessment and posterior inference. Throughout the manual, a linear regression example is used to illustrate the software.},

Age differences were slight for passive tasks. For the working memory task, significant declines were found between the ages of 60 to 69 and 70+ years.

abstract = {Speech perception requires the decoding of complex acoustic patterns. According to most cognitive models of spoken word recognition, this complexity is dealt with before lexical access via a process of abstraction from the acoustic signal to pre-lexical categories. It is currently unclear how these categories are implemented in the auditory cortex. Recent advances in animal neurophysiology and human functional imaging have made it possible to investigate the processing of speech in terms of probabilistic cortical maps rather than simple cognitive subtraction, which will enable us to relate neurometric data more directly to behavioural studies. We suggest that integration of insights from cognitive science, neurophysiology and functional imaging is necessary for furthering our understanding of pre-lexical abstraction in the cortex.},

Observers are assumed to enter the focused-attention mode on a proportion of trials that matches the validity of the cue and to enter the diffuse-attention mode on the remaining trials. The present experiment tested and rejected the response time mixture prediction of the 2-process model. An instance of the class of 1-process models in which perceptual objects are sampled in parallel according to the validity of the cue was evaluated. A stochastic simulation of the model yielded results that paralleled those of the experiment.},

Previous research has shown that eye movements to objects in the visual environment are locked to linguistic input. More surprisingly, listeners fixate on now-empty regions that had previously been occupied by relevant objects. This 'looking at nothing' phenomenon has been linked to the claim that the visual system constructs sparse representations of the external world and relies on saccades and fixations to extract information in a just-in-time manner. Our model provides a different explanation: based on recent work in visual cognition and memory, it assumes that the visual system creates and stores detailed internal memory representations, and that looking at nothing facilitates retrieval of those representations.},

@article{Canestrelli2013,
abstract = {Causal connectives are often considered to provide crucial information about the discourse structure; they signal a causal relation between two text segments. However, in many languages of the world causal connectives specialise in either subjective or objective causal relations. We investigate whether this type of (discourse) information is used during the online processing of causal connectives by focusing on the Dutch connectives want and omdat, both translated by because. In three eye-tracking studies we demonstrate that the Dutch connective want, which is a prototypical marker of subjective CLAIM?ARGUMENT relations, leads to an immediate processing disadvantage compared to omdat, a prototypical marker of objective CONSEQUENCE?CAUSE relations. This effect was observed at the words immediately following the connective, at which point readers cannot yet establish the causal relation on the basis of the content, which means that the effect is solely induced by the connectives. In Experiment 2 we demonstrate that this effect is related to the representation of the first clause of a want relation as a mental state. In Experiment 3, we show that the use of omdat in relations that do not allow for a CONSEQUENCE?CAUSE interpretation leads to serious processing difficulties at the end of those relations. On the basis of these results, we argue that want triggers a subjective mental state interpretation of S1, whereas omdat triggers the construction of an objective CONSEQUENCE?CAUSE relation. These results illustrate that causal connectives provide subtle information about semantic-pragmatic distinctions between types of causal relations, which immediately influences online processing.},

abstract = {Understanding how response time (RT) changes with manipulations has been critical in distinguishing among theories in cognition. It is well known that aggregating data distorts functional relationships (e.g., Estes, 1956). Less well appreciated is a second pitfall: Minimizing squared errors (i.e., OLS regression) also distorts estimated functional forms with RT data. We discuss three properties of RT that should be modeled for accurate analysis and, on the basis of these three properties, provide a hierarchical Weibull regression model for regressing RT onto covariates. Hierarchical regression model analysis of lexical decision task data reveals that RT decreases as a power function of word frequency with the scale of RT decreasing 11{\%} for every doubling of word frequency. A detailed discussion of the model and analysis techniques are presented as archived materials and may be downloaded from www.psychonomic.org/archive.},

In all three groups, fixation times on words up to the to-be-remembered (TBR) word became shorter and the time spent on the TBR longer as memory load in the task increased. The results of Experiment 2, however, show that span groups differ in the use of memory encoding strategies: individuals with a low span use mainly rehearsal, whereas individuals with a high span use almost exclusively semantic elaboration. The results indicate that the use of elaborative strategies may enhance span performance but that not all individuals are necessarily able to use such strategies efficiently.},

- friedman {\{}{\&}{\}} miyake: sentence rt neg. corr. with span score (but: only total reading times, TBR included)
- engle et al. (1992): spr shows diff. between low and high span readers on rt first and TBR word
- mcnamar {\{}{\&}{\}} scott (2001): high span readers more elaborate encoding strategies
- turley-ames {\{}{\&}{\}} whitfield (2003) and dunlosky {\{}{\&}{\}} kane: strategy-use in OSPAN
- both studies: high span = more elaborative encoding strategies
- exp-paced in both experiments


exp 1
- finnish RSPAN, all target words nouns
- eye fixation measures seperatiely for words in different regions (first word, middle, TBR word)
- em data as function of sentence region and memory load
{\textgreater} exp.-paced and therefore stringent test of importance of strategic online processing in span task performance (exp pressed button when s was finished reading, is that really exp.-paced)
- if correct order was remembered, do not start with last word!
- three sets per size
- score: total number correctly recalled words (order did not matter)
- tertile split
- no seperate analysis of skipping rates and reading times
- results set-size 4: no difference span groups gaze duration, sig. main effect sentence region and sig. region x load (beginning and middle decrease with load, tbr increase); overall: no span group differences; as memory load increases, s spend more time on tbr and less on other regions
- results set-size 5: main effect region; main effect load (decreased rt beginning and end, no change on tbr)
- discussion: no diff. between span groups in how they distributed processing time between regions


exp. 2
- like exp.1, but retrospective strategy report (without options given, categorization by exp.)
- three cat.: semantic elaboration, silent rehearsal, selective processing
- tertile split
- low span: rehearsal, little semantic el. and sel. proc.
- high span: mostly sem. elab.
{\textgreater} low span readers ineffective strategies
- some low span readers tried to employ better strategy but failed {\textgreater} in line with turley-ames: strategy-use important,but more to it than knowledge


general disc.
- what is crucial in the ind. diff. in rspan is not strat. allocation of proc. time on the sentences, but memory strategies},

The correspondence gives rise to two methods of clustering that are computationally rapid and invariant under monotonic transformations of the data. In an explicitly defined sense, one method forms clusters that are optimally connected, while the other forms clusters that are optimally compact.},

The author describes some major problems with NHST which include the usual impossibility of a typical null hypothesis, lack of attention to statistical power, and the NHST provides only imprecise information about the validity of the null hypothesis. Some alternative techniques the author recommends are as follows: (1) plot the data rather than putting them in tabular form; (2) put confidence intervals around important sample statistics; (3) use meta-analysis; and (4) use planned comparisons.},

In this article, we explore the distributional effects of a word frequency manipulation on fixation durations in normal reading, making use of data from two recent eye movement experiments (Drieghe, Rayner, {\&} Pollatsek, 2008; White, 2008). The ex-Gaussian distribution provided a good fit to the shape of individual subjects' distributions in both experiments. The frequency manipulation affected both the shift and skew of the distributions, in both experiments, and this conclusion was supported by the nonparametric vincentizing technique. Finally, a new experiment demonstrated that White's (2008) frequency manipulation also affects both shift and skew in response-time distributions in the lexical decision task. These results argue against models of eye movement control in reading that propose that word frequency influences only a subset of fixations and support models in which there is a tight connection between eye movement control and the progress of lexical processing.},

The present article shows how one of these models, E-Z Reader (Pollatsek, Reichle, {\&} Rayner, 2006c), can be augmented to redress this limitation. Simulations show that with a few simple assumptions, the model can account for the fact that effects of higher level language processing are not observed on eye movements when such processing is occurring without difficulty, but can capture the patterns of eye movements that are observed when such processing is slowed or disrupted.},

A sustained left anterior negativity was observed for object questions with long filler-gap distance but not for short object questions. This negativity was modulated by individual differences in working memory capacity. No comparable negativity was elicited by WHETHER-questions which did not contain a filler-gap dependency. A positive-going ERP effect was observed for short and long object WH-questions at the position of the second noun phrase. We interpret the sustained negativity as reflecting working memory processes required for maintaining the dislocated object in memory. Processing costs associated with integrating the stored element into the phrase structure representation are indicated by the local positivity. These results support the notion of separable syntactic working memory and syntactic integration cost components as causes of processing difficulty in complex sentences.},

Providing a broad, accessible treatment of the theory as well as linguistic applications, Semisupervised Learning for Computational Linguistics offers self-contained coverage of semisupervised methods that includes background material on supervised and unsupervised learning. The book presents a brief history of semisupervised learning and its place in the spectrum of learning methods before moving on to discuss well-known natural language processing methods, such as self-training and co-training. It then centers on machine learning techniques, including the boundary-oriented methods of perceptrons, boosting, support vector machines (SVMs), and the null-category noise model. In addition, the book covers clustering, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, related generative methods, and agreement methods. It concludes with the graph-based method of label propagation as well as a detailed discussion of spectral methods. Taking an intuitive approach to the material, this lucid book facilitates the application of semisupervised learning methods to natural language processing and provides the framework and motivation for a more systematic study of machine learning.},

abstract = {People generally slow down after they make an error, a phenomenon that is more pronounced for older individuals than it is for young individuals. Here, we examine the origin of this age-related difference in posterror slowing (PES) by applying the diffusion model to data from young and older participants performing a random dot motion task and a lexical decision task. Results show that the PES effects on response time and accuracy were qualitatively different for young and older participants. A diffusion model analysis revealed that following an error, older participants became more cautious, processed information less effectively, and spent more time on irrelevant processes. This pattern was evident in both the random dot motion task and the lexical decision task. For young participants, in contrast, the origin of the PES effect depended on the task that was performed: In the random dot motion task, the PES effect was due to time spent on irrelevant processes; in the lexical decision task, the PES effect was due to increased caution and decreased effectiveness in information processing. Overall, PES effects were much larger in the lexical decision task than in the random dot motion task. These findings indicate that PES originates from the interplay of different psychological processes whose contribution depends on both task settings and individual differences.},

abstract = {Where do the different sentence orders in the languages of the world come from? Recently, it has been suggested that there is a basic sentence order, SOV (Subject-Object-Verb), which was the starting point for other sentence orders. Backup for this claim was found in newly emerging languages, as well as in experiments where people are asked to convey simple meanings in improvised gesture production. In both cases, researchers found that the predominant word order is SOV. Recent literature has shown that the pragmatic rule 'Agent first' drives the preference for S initial word order, but this rule does not decide between SOV and SVO. This paper presents experimental evidence for grounding the word order that emerges in gesture production in semantic properties of the message to be conveyed. We focus on the role of the verb, and argue that the preference for SOV word order reported in earlier experiments is due to the use of extensional verbs (e.g. throw). With intensional verbs like think, the object is dependent on the agent's thought, and our experiment confirms that such verbs lead to a preference for SVO instead. We conclude that the meaning of the verb plays a crucial role in the sequencing of utterances in emerging language systems. This finding is relevant for the debate on language evolution, because it suggests that semantics underlies the early formation of syntactic rules. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that the spatial direction of endogenous covert spatial attention in one sensory modality can crossmodally influence early processing of stimuli in a different modality. However, spatial locations are initially coded according to different frames of reference for different modalities (e.g., body-centered for touch versus retinocentric vision) and postural changes (e.g., gaze shifts) will realign these. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate how the direction of endogenous tactile attention affects sensory-specific visual ERP components. Critically, by manipulating direction of gaze, we were able to test whether any crossmodal effects depend on visual and tactile projections to a common hemisphere, on common locations in external space, or on some combination of the two. We found that both P1 and N1 visual components were modulated according to the direction of endogenous tactile attention. While the P1 crossmodal effect followed purely hemispheric constraints, the attentional modulation of N1 appeared to combine both anatomical and external spatial constraints.},

The goal of model selection is to identify the model, from a set of candidate models, that permits the shortest description length (code) of the data. Since Rissanen originally formalized the problem using the crude 'two-part code' MDL method in the 1970s, many significant strides have been made, especially in the 1990s, with the culmination of the development of the refined 'universal code' MDL method, dubbed Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML).

abstract = {Recent event-related potential studies report a P600 effect to incongruous verbs preceded by semantically associated inanimate noun-phrase (NP) arguments, e.g., "eat" in "At breakfast the eggs would eat...". This P600 effect may reflect the processing cost incurred when semantic-thematic relationships between critical verbs and their preceding NP argument(s) bias towards different interpretations to those dictated by their sentences' syntactic structures. We have termed such violations of alternative thematic roles, 'thematic role violations.' Semantic-thematic relationships are influenced both by semantic associations and by more basic semantic features, such as a noun's animacy. This study determined whether a P600 effect can be evoked by verbs whose thematic structures are violated by their preceding inanimate NP arguments, even in the absence of close semantic-associative relationships with these arguments or their preceding contexts. ERPs were measured to verbs under four conditions: (1) non-violated ("At breakfast the boys would eat..."); (2) preceded by introductory clauses and animate NPs that violated their pragmatic expectations but not their thematic structures ("At breakfast the boys would plant..."); (3) preceded by semantically related contexts but inanimate NPs that violated their thematic structures ("At breakfast the eggs would eat..."); (4) preceded by semantically unrelated contexts and inanimate NPs that also violated their thematic structures ("At breakfast the eggs would plant..."). Pragmatically non-thematic role violated verbs preceded by unrelated contexts and animate NPs evoked robust N400 effects and small P600 effects. Thematically violated verbs preceded by inanimate argument NPs evoked robust P600 effects but no N400 effects, regardless of whether these inanimate arguments or their preceding contexts were semantically related or unrelated to these verbs. These findings suggest that semantic-thematic relations, related to animacy constraints on verbs' arguments, are computed online and can immediately impact verb processing within active, English sentences.},

Processing anaphoric constructions: Insights from electrophysiological studies

Processing anaphoric constructions: Insights from electrophysiological studies

- Callahan, S )



An exhaustive review of electrophysiological studies testing anaphoric constructions leads to the novel conclusion that the effects of these characteristics are reducible to differences in the time-course of the availability of information and the ability to form expectations about anaphoric relationships.


To forecast the conclusions, the findings from this review reveal that the effects of certain characteristics central to current linguistic and psycholinguistic theories and models of anaphora, namely the underlying linguistic mechanism and the type of anaphor, are largely reducible to differences in the time-course of the availability of information and the ability of the language processor to form expectations about the anaphoric relationship.


see Brown, van Berkum, {\{}{\&}{\}} Hagoort, 2000; Kutas, Federmeier, Coulson, King, {\{}{\&}{\}} Mu ̈ nte, 2000; Osterhout, Kim, {\{}{\&}{\}} Kuperberg, to appear, for reviews and Friederici, 2002 for an integrated model of the types of processing indexed by a variety of electrophysiological waveform components


Since P600 effects vary in terms of timing and scalp distribution, some researchers have proposed that certain of these effects should be distinguished from one another, e.g. the distinction between the early and late P600 proposed by Hagoort, Brown, and Osterhout (1999) or the distinction between the frontal and parietal P600 proposed by Friederici (2002) and Kaan and Swaab (2003).


To oversimplify, these constraints basically translate into a requirement that the antecedent of a reflexive must occur in a very local syntactic domain (often the same clause), while the antecedent of a pronoun or a noun phrase may not occur in this domain.


Accessibility theories propose that under optimal conditions, speakers produce anaphors that help the hearer identify the appropriate antecedent.


Accessibility theories of anaphoric usage note that speakers tend to pair less informative anaphors with more accessible antecedents and more informative anaphors with less accessible antecedents. Accessibility-based models of anaphoric processing (Almor, 1998; Gordon {\{}{\&}{\}} Hendrick, 1998; Grosz, Joshi, {\{}{\&}{\}} Weinstein, 1995; Murphy, 1985; Walker, Joshi, {\{}{\&}{\}} Prince, 1998) suggest that this correspondence is also relevant to the processing and interpretation of anaphors.


According to Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998), the most accessible antecedent in a sentence (i.e. the preferred forwardlooking center) is most likely to be referred to in a subsequent sentence. Therefore, this type of anaphoric reference (i.e. a discourse topic continuation) will be easiest to process and a reference to a less accessible antecedent (i.e. a discourse topic shift) will be associated with processing difficulty.


In a similar vein, there is also evidence for the informational load hypothesis (Almor, 1998) that predicts that a full form will not be associated with processing difficulty when there is a functional justification for its use (i.e. it adds additional information).


Overall, it is clear that the accessibility of the antecedent interacts with the form of the anaphor to determine processing difficulty.


Along these lines, a number of models of anaphoric processing have suggested that pronominal interpretation involves two stages (Corbett {\{}{\&}{\}} Chang, 1983; Garrod {\{}{\&}{\}} Sanford, 1994; Garrod {\{}{\&}{\}} Terras, 2000; Nicol {\{}{\&}{\}} Swinney, 1989). In the first stage, sometimes referred to as bonding, candidate antecedents are activated and this activation is constrained by featural constraints (e.g. gender and number) and structural constraints such as those expressed in Binding Theory (e.g. Nicol {\{}{\&}{\}} Swinney, 1989). In the second stage, sometimes referred to as resolution, contextual information and real-world knowledge reduce the number of candidates (e.g. Garnham, Traxler, Oakhill, {\{}{\&}{\}} Gernsbacher, 1996).


Linguistic theories and psycholinguistic processing models consider an additional factor, namely the type of underlying linguistic mechanism that generated the anaphoric relationship. Two major types of linguistic mechanisms are distinguished: (a) co-indexation as in (6), a noun--pronoun relationship, and (b) movement1 as in (7), a wh-question, or (8), a relative clause construction.


Of course, relationships resulting from movement are closely related to those resulting from co-indexation since movement relationships also involve co-indexation of the antecedent and trace.3 However, one critical distinction is that in co-indexation relationships both the antecedent and the anaphor are in the proper position for interpretation (more formally, to receive a theta-role from the verb) while in movement relationships the antecedent is displaced from this position.


For example, in movement constructions, the antecedent and trace must occur within a fairly local syntactic domain, the sentence, and even within this domain their relationship is syntactically constrained in additional ways, construed as island constraints (Ross, 1967) or barriers to movement (Chomsky, 1986).


The co-indexation constructions that have received the most study to date using electrophysiological techniques are relationships where NPs serve as the antecedent and NPs, pronouns, or reflexives serve as the anaphor.


Therefore, the language processor has three major tasks in movement constructions: (a) to recognize the antecedent and store the information for later interpretation, (b) to retrieve the antecedent information at the trace position and (c) to integrate the antecedent information with the surrounding context.


Behavioral studies have consistently found that object-movement constructions are more difficult to process than subjectmovement constructions (e.g. Clifton, Speer, {\{}{\&}{\}} Abney, 1991; Frazier, 1987b; Just {\{}{\&}{\}} Carpenter, 1992). This processing difficulty has generally been suggested to result from the fact that object-movement constructions require the antecedent phrase to be stored in working memory until it can be retrieved at the correct position for interpretation.


Despite this uncertainty regarding the relationship between the two types of LAN effects, it is clear from other studies that, in general, left anterior negativities are associated with verbal working memory load (e.g. Ruchkin, Johnson, Grafman, Canoune, {\{}{\&}{\}} Ritter, 1992).


As suggested by the Active Filler Strategy (Clifton {\{}{\&}{\}} Frazier, 1989; Frazier {\{}{\&}{\}} Flores D'Arcais, 1989) and supported by numerous behavioral studies (e.g. Crain {\{}{\&}{\}} Fodor, 1985; Nicol {\{}{\&}{\}} Swinney, 1989; Stowe, 1986; Traxler {\{}{\&}{\}} Pickering, 1996), a trace is posited at the first possible position.


In contrast to the effect of a semantic violation, when syntactic information violates the expectation of the trace position, such as when the trace position is filled by an ungrammatical object (i.e. the insertion of the phrase, the camel, in sentence (21), as compared to (20)), a left-lateralized anterior negativity between 100 and 400ms (i.e. an ELAN) is observed (Hestvik et al., 2006).


When the semantic characteristics of the antecedent (i.e. animacy) and structural information are in conflict, a posterior positivity 400--700 ms post-onset of the word following the trace position is also observed (Weckerly {\{}{\&}{\}} Kutas, 1999), suggesting that the conflicting information makes the integration of the antecedent with the verb more difficult.


When a movement construction is temporarily ambiguous between a subject and an object reading, participants display a preference for pursuing a subject reading.


This effect typically has a centro-parietal or posterior distribution (Friederici et al., 1998, 2001; Mecklinger et al., 1995; but c.f. Penolazzi et al., 2005 who found a more anterior distribution) and is sometimes only observed for fast comprehenders (Mecklinger et al., 1995) or participants with high working memory capacity (Friederici et al., 1998).


Overall, then, the data from ERP studies suggests that relationships generated by the movement of an overt phrase involve the following processes (summarized in Table 3): 1. Storing the antecedent in working memory, typically indexed by a sustained left anterior negativity (i.e. sustained LAN) beginning after the antecedent and persisting until and/ or past the trace position. 2. Retrieving the antecedent from working memory, typically indexed by a phasic left anterior negativity (i.e. a phasic LAN) between 300 and 500 ms post-onset of the word following the trace position. 3. Integrating the antecedent with the anaphor site and surrounding context, typically indexed by a broadly distributed positivity with an onset between approximately 300 and 700 ms post-onset of the word following the trace position (i.e. a P600).


In movement relationships, the parser encounters a phrase in a non-canonical position and initiates a search in upcoming context for a corresponding anaphor. In contrast, in coindexation relationships, the parser encounters an anaphor and initiates a search in previous context for the antecedent.


In addition, relative to co-referential names, co-referential pronouns elicit a larger amplitude left anterior negativity between 270 and 420 ms post word-onset (i.e. a phasic LAN), reflecting the fact that the retrieval process for pronouns is associated with additional difficulty, and a parietal negativity between 510 and 600 ms post wordonset (i.e. possibly an N400), for which the interpretation is less clear (Streb, Ro ̈ sler, {\{}{\&}{\}} Hennighausen, 1999).


When the features of the anaphor (e.g. case, gender, number) are incompatible with the only possible antecedent, the anaphor elicits a broadly distributed positivity (often with a centro-parietal or parietal maximum) between approximately 400 and 1000 ms post word-onset (i.e. a P600)


In languages where biological and syntactic gender can be dissociated (e.g. German), double violations of both biological and syntactic gender elicit a positivity with a broad distribution (Hammer et al., 2005; Schmitt et al., 2002) while pure violations of syntactic gender elicit a positivity with a more fronto-central distribution (Schmitt et al., 2002).


Fitting with evidence of comprehension difficulty in behavioral studies (e.g. Clark {\{}{\&}{\}} Sengul, 1979; Gordon {\{}{\&}{\}} Scearce, 1995), in an ERP study (Streb, Hennighausen, {\{}{\&}{\}} Ro ̈ sler, 2004), a more distant antecedent, as in the comparison of (37) to (36), was associated with a larger amplitude centro-parietal negativity between approximately 360 and 480 ms postonset of the anaphor (i.e. an N400), reflecting semantic integration difficulty.


In summary, processing an overt anaphor, like processing any word, is associated with a centro-parietal negativity (i.e. an N400) for which the amplitude reflects the ease of semantic processing.


In elliptical constructions, encountering the anaphor is associated with a centroposterior negativity between approximately 100 and 300 ms post-onset of word following the anaphor position (see Fig. 5) reflecting the fact that this word is unexpected (Kaan et al., 2004).


Overall, then, expectancy seems to play an important role in determining the effect elicited by encountering a null anaphor in a co-indexation relationship. Unlike in movement constructions, where the language processor has already identified the antecedent and is actively searching for the anaphor position, the null anaphor in coindexation relationships comes as a surprise.


Due to the limited amount of research, conclusions about the processing of coindexation relationships involving a null anaphor are necessarily tentative. Nonetheless, it is clear that the following processes are involved (summarized in Table 5): 1. Detecting the anaphor and identifying the antecedent, where the detection of a null anaphor elicits a centro-posterior negativity between 100 and 300 ms post-onset of the critical word in elliptical constructions and a central or posterior positivity between approximately 300 and 600ms post-onset of the word following the anaphor (i.e. a P600) in control constructions. 2. Selecting and retrieving the antecedent, indexed by a left anterior negativity between 300 and 500 ms post-onset of the word following the anaphor site (i.e. a phasic LAN) in control constructions and a right anterior positivity between 300 and 500 ms in elliptical constructions. 3. Integrating the antecedent and anaphor site, where integration difficulty is indexed by a centro-parietal negativity between 300 and 500 ms post-onset of the word following the anaphor (i.e. an N400) and/or a posterior positivity between 600 and 900ms (i.e. a P600).


The major difference between movement constructions and co-indexation constructions with a null anaphor is the point at which the language processor detects the anaphoric relationship.


Since the parser cannot fully interpret the antecedent at this point, it stores the phrase in working memory, a process typically indexed by a sustained left anterior negativity (i.e. a sustained LAN). This sustained negativity does not occur in co-indexation constructions because the parser cannot detect that the antecedent phrase will be needed later and therefore does not actively maintain it in working memory.


In both movement and co-indexation constructions with a null anaphor, the antecedent must be retrieved from working memory once the null anaphor position is detected. This process is indexed by a left anterior negativity between 300 and 500 ms post-onset of the critical word (i.e. a phasic LAN) in movement constructions and control constructions and by a right anterior positivity in the same time window in elliptical constructions.


Another possible reason for the observed difference is that the elliptical constructions tested so far involve VP antecedents and anaphors while the movement and control constructions involve NP antecedents and anaphors.


Future studies should investigate this possibility, perhaps by testing elliptical constructions involving NP anaphors or constructions involving the movement of verbs.


A4


As mentioned previously, the type of anaphor is also related to whether the anaphor provides clues to the antecedent. This means that, as predicted by accessibility theories, a less informative anaphor should be used by the speaker when the intended antecedent can be easily retrieved by the hearer. This prediction is supported by evidence that the use of an over-informative overt anaphor to refer to a highly accessible antecedent is associated with processing difficulty.


The ERP data concur with introspective and behavioral data in suggesting that the language processor is aware of these constraints. ERP studies also suggest that these constraints are syntactic in nature (or at least have consequences for syntactic processing) since the violation of such constraints is associated with attempts at syntactic revision indexed by either an early positivity or a late positivity (i.e. a P600).


The evidence for two-stage models of processing from ERP studies is more mixed.


Certainly, there is ample ERP evidence for a bonding process triggered by the processing of the anaphor during which featural and structural constraints are used to identify potential antecedents. There is also evidence that this process is neurally dissociable from the process of retrieving and integrating the information from the antecedent.


From a neural perspective this stage may mainly be visible in terms of its outcome, the retrieval process. Also, contrary to the predictions of two-stage models of processing, the language processor appears to make referential commitments on the basis of semantic or discourse knowledge available before the anaphor is encountered even when the featural characteristics of the anaphor contradict this commitment.


1. Constraints on the distribution of different anaphoric types and forms. 2. Effects of characteristics of the antecedent, characteristics of the anaphor, and the interaction between the two. 3. Effects of expectation (syntactic-, semantic-, and discourse-driven) and processing difficulty or reanalysis due to the violation of an expectation. 4. Interactions with parsing, working memory and attentional processes. The majority of current theories of anaphora are aimed at describing only one or two of the above-mentioned attributes; for this reason, no single theory is sufficient to explain all the available data.


Viewing variation along this dimension as a direct result of the different time-courses of the availability of information reveals that the processing of all anaphoric relationships is characterized by similar processes including the processing of the anaphor, the identification of possible antecedents, the selection and retrieval of a single antecedent, and the integration of the antecedent information with the anaphor and the surrounding context.


To conclude, then, after summarizing and integrating the ERP studies of anaphora to date, it is clear that from a neurophysiological perspective a comprehensive theory of anaphoric processing is a viable enterprise.


Since the majority of research to date has investigated relationships involving NP anaphors, additional research is also urgently needed on anaphors that refer to phrases other than nouns (i.e. VP anaphors, inflectional phrase (IP) anaphors). It will be important to see whether the processing of these types of anaphors involves the same core processes and is affected by the same factors detailed in previous sections.},

abstract = {A method is presented for calculating the amount of information conveyed to a hearer by a speaker emitting a sentence generated by a probabilistic grammar known to both parties. The method applies the work of Grenander (1967) to the intermediate states of a top-down parser. This allows the uncertainty about structural ambiguity to be calculated at each point in a sentence. Subtracting these values at successive points gives the information conveyed by a word in a sentence. Word-by-word information conveyed is calculated for several small probabilistic grammars, and it is suggested that the number of bits conveyed per word is a determinant of reading times and other measures of cognitive load.},

abstract = {Behavior and experience are organized around the enjoyment and pursuit of incentives. During the time that an incentive is behaviorally salient, an organism is especially responsive to incentive-related cues. This sustained sensitivity requires postulating a continuing state (denoted by a construct, current concern) with a definite onset (commitment) and offset (consummation or disengagement). Disengagement follows frustration, accompanies the behavioral process of extinction, and involves an incentive-disengagement cycle of invigoration, aggression, depression, and recovery. Depression is thus a normal part of disengagement that may be either adaptive or maladaptive for the individual but is probably adaptive for the species. The theory offers implications for motivation; etiology, symptomatology, and treatment of depression; drug use; and other social problem areas.},

abstract = {Social scientists often compare subclasses of populations or manipulatons. For example, in comparing task-completion times across two levels of a manipulations, if one group has faster overall mean response, it is natural to ask if the fastest 10{\%} of the first group has a faster mean than the fastest 10{\%} of the second group, and so on. Delta plots, a type of quantile-quantile residual plot used by psychologists, shed light on these comparisons and motivate new notions of stochastic ordering. If all percentile classes have faster mean in one group than in the other, we say that there is coherent mean ordering and that one group stochastically dominates the other in mean. A related notion of coherent variance ordering can be defined similarly. Violations of coherent orderings of means or variances are diagnostic signatures of complex effects and suggest further avenues of study. In this note, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for stochastic dominance in mean and variance. We show that stochastic mean dominance is exactly equivalent to the usual stochastic dominance and stochastic variance dominance is equivalent to ordering of the first derivative of the quantile functions.},

abstract = { The understanding of the control of eye movements has greatly benefited
from the analysis of mathematical models. Currentlymost comprehensive
models include sequential shifts of visual attention. Here we propose
an alternative model of eye movementcontrol, which includes three
new principles: spatially distributed lexical processing, a separation
of saccade timing from saccadetarget selection, and autonomous (random)
generation of saccades with foveal inhibition. These three features
provide a commoncontrol mechanism for fixations, refixations, and
regressions. Consequently, the model is called SWIFT (Saccade-generation
withinhibition by foveal targets). Results from numerical simulations
are in good agreement with effects of word frequency on single-fixation,
first-fixation, and gaze durations as well as fixation and word skipping
probabilities in first-pass analysis. The modelinherently produces
complex eye movement patterns including refixations and regressions
due to its underlying dynamical principles.},

abstract = {Standard text reading involves frequent eye movements that go against normal reading order. The function of these "regressions" is still largely unknown. The most obvious explanation is that regressions allow for the rereading of previously fixated words. Alternatively, physically returning the eyes to a word's location could cue the reader's memory for that word, effectively aiding the comprehension process via location priming (the "deictic pointer hypothesis"). In Experiment 1, regression frequency was reduced when readers knew that information was no longer available for rereading. In Experiment 2, readers listened to auditorily presented text while moving their eyes across visual placeholders on the screen. Here, rereading was impossible, but deictic pointers remained available, yet the readers did not make targeted regressions in this experiment. In Experiment 3, target words in normal sentences were changed after reading. Where the eyes later regressed to these words, participants generally remained unaware of the change, and their answers to comprehension questions indicated that the new meaning of the changed word was what determined their sentence representations. These results suggest that readers use regressions to reread words and not to cue their memory for previously read words.},

@article{HupeEtAl2001,
abstract = {We analyzed the extracellular responses of 70 V1 neurons (recorded
in 3 anesthetized macaque monkeys) to a single oriented line segment
(or bar) placed within the cell classical receptive field (RF), or
center of the RF. These responses could be modulated when rings of
bars were placed entirely outside, but around the RF (the "near"
surround region), as described in previous studies. Suppression was
the main effect. The response was enhanced for 12 neurons when orthogonal
bars in the surround were presented instead of bars having the same
orientation as the center bar. This orientation contrast property
is possibly involved in the mediation of perceptual pop-out. The
enhancement was delayed compared with the onset of the response by
about 40 ms. We also observed a suppression originating specifically
from the flanks of the surround. This "side-inhibition," significant
for nine neurons, was delayed by about 20 ms. We tested whether these
center/surround interactions in V1 depend on feedback connections
from area V2. V2 was inactivated by GABA injections. We used devices
made of six micropipettes to inactivate the convergent zone from
V2 to V1. We could reliably inactivate a 2- to 4-mm-wide region of
V2. Inactivation of V2 had no effect on the center/surround interactions
of V1 neurons, even those that were delayed. Therefore the center/surround
interactions of V1 neurons that might be involved in pop-out do not
appear to depend on feedback connections from V2, at least in the
anesthetized monkey. We conclude that these properties are probably
shaped by long-range connections within V1 or depend on other feedback
connections. The main effect of V2 inactivation was a decrease of
the response to the single bar for about 10{\%} of V1 neurons. The decrease
was delayed by {\textless}20 ms after the response onset. Even the earliest
neurons to respond could be affected by the feedback from V2. Together
with the results on feedback connections from MT (previous paper),
these findings show that feedback connections potentiate the responses
to stimulation of the RF center and are recruited very early for
the treatment of visual information.},

abstract = {The neural mechanisms underlying reaction times have previously been modelled in two distinct ways. When stimuli are hard to detect, response time tends to follow a random-walk model that integrates noisy sensory signals. But studies investigating the influence of higher-level factors such as prior probability and response urgency typically use highly detectable targets, and response times then usually correspond to a linear rise-to-threshold mechanism. Here we show that a model incorporating both types of element in series - a detector integrating noisy afferent signals, followed by a linear rise-to-threshold performing decision - successfully predicts not only mean response times but, much more stringently, the observed distribution of these times and the rate of decision errors over a wide range of stimulus detectability. By reconciling what previously may have seemed to be conflicting theories, we are now closer to having a complete description of reaction time and the decision processes that underlie it.},

abstract = {The present fMRI study aimed at identifying neural correlates of the syntax-semantics interface in language comprehension. This was achieved by examining what we refer to as "argument hierarchy construction", i.e., determining which participant in a sentence is the "Actor" and which is the "Undergoer" of the event expressed by the verb. In order to identify the neural bases of argument hierarchy processing, we manipulated three factors known to influence the complexity of argument hierarchy construction in German, namely argument order, verb class and morphological ambiguity. Increased argument hierarchization demands engendered enhanced activation in a network of inferior frontal, posterior superior temporal, premotor and parietal areas. Moreover, components of this network were differentially modulated by the individual factors. In particular, the left posterior superior temporal sulcus showed an enhanced sensitivity for morphological information and the syntactic realization of the verb-based argument hierarchy, while the activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis) corresponded to linearization demands and was independent of morphological information. We therefore argue that, for German, posterior superior temporal and inferior frontal regions engage in the extraction of actorhood from morphosyntactic structure and in the sequential realization of hierarchical interpretive dependencies, respectively.},

abstract = {The goal of this article is to explore the utility of experimental syntax tech- niques in the investigation of syntactic variation. To that end, we applied the facto- rial definition of island effects made available by experimental syntax (e.g., Sprouse et al. 2012) to four island types (wh/whether, complex NP, subject, and adjunct), two dependency types (wh-interrogative clause dependencies and relative clause de- pendencies) and two languages (English and Italian). The results of 8 primary ex- periments suggest that there is indeed variation across dependency types, suggesting that wh-interrogative clause dependencies and relative clause dependencies cannot be identical at every level of analysis; however, the pattern of variation observed in these experiments is not exactly the pattern of variation previously reported in the literature (e.g., Rizzi 1982). We review six major syntactic approaches to the analy- sis of island effects (Subjacency, CED, Barriers, Relativized Minimality, Structure- building, and Phases) and discuss the implications of these results for these analyses. We also present 4 supplemental experiments testing complex wh-phrases (also called D-linked or lexically restricted wh-phrases) for all four island types using the facto- rial design in order to tease apart the contribution of dependency type from featural specification. The results of the supplemental experiments confirm that dependency type is the major source of variation, not featural specification, while providing a concrete quantification of what exactly the effect of complex wh-phrases on island effects is.},

abstract = {Speakers are known to make subject-verb agreement errors both when a number-mismatching noun intervenes between the head of the subject phrase and the verb (e.g., *The key to the cabinets are on the table) and in configurations in which there is a number-mismatching noun that does not intervene (e.g., *The cabinets that the key open are on the second floor). Using a two-choice response time (RT) paradigm, Staub (2009) found that correct agreement decisions were also slowed in both cases. The present article reports a new experiment designed to explore whether these two RT effects are qualitatively similar or different. Fitting of the ex-Gaussian distribution (Ratcliff, 1979) to individual subjects' RT data, in each condition, demonstrated that the effect of an intervening number attractor on correct RT is due to both a shifting of the distribution to the right and to increased skewing, while the effect of a non-intervening attractor is almost entirely a skewing effect. A non-parametric vincentizing procedure supported these conclusions. These findings are taken to support the view that these two types of number attraction involve distinct processing mechanisms. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of "universal," we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills.},

We apply a tailored process model of choice RT to a speeded semantic categorization task in order to deconfound different sources of variability in RT. Our model is based on a diffusion model of choice RT, extended to include crossed random effects (of items and participants). This model retains the interesting process interpretation of the diffusion model's parameters, but it can be applied to choice RTs even in the case where there are few or no repeated measurements of each participant-item combination. Different aspects of the response process are then linked to different types of item properties. A typicality measure turns out to predict the rate of information uptake, while a lexicographic measure predicts the stimulus encoding time.

abstract = {A method of obtaining an average reaction time distribution for a group of subjects is described. The method is particularly useful for cases in which data from many subjects are available but there are only 10-20 reaction time ob- servations per subject cell. Essentially, reaction times for each subject are organized in ascending order, and quantiles are calculated. The quantiles are then averaged over subjects to give group quantiles (cf. Vincent learning curves). From the group quantiles, a group reaction time distribution can be constructed. It is shown that this method of averaging is exact for certain distributions (i.e., the resulting distribution belongs to the same family as the individual distributions). Furthermore, Monte Carlo studies and application of the method to the combined data from three large experiments provide evidence that properties derived from the group reaction time distribution are much the same as average properties derived from the data of individual subjects. This article also examines how to quantitatively describe the shape of reaction time distributions. The use of moments and cumulants as sources of information about distribution shape is evaluated and rejected because of extreme depen- dence on long, outlier reaction times. As an alternative, the use of explicit distribution functions as approximations to reaction time distributions is con- sidered.},

abstract = {One-choice reaction-time (RT) tasks are used in many domains, including assessments of motor vehicle driving and assessments of the cognitive/behavioral consequences of sleep deprivation. In such tasks, subjects are asked to respond when they detect the onset of a stimulus; the dependent variable is RT. We present a cognitive model for one-choice RT tasks that uses a one-boundary diffusion process to represent the accumulation of stimulus information. When the accumulated evidence reaches a decision criterion, a response is initiated. This model is distinct in accounting for the RT distributions observed for one-choice RT tasks, which can have long tails that have not been accurately captured by earlier cognitive modeling approaches. We show that the model explains performance on a brightness-detection task (a "simple RT task") and on a psychomotor vigilance test. The latter is used extensively to examine the clinical and behavioral effects of sleep deprivation. For the brightness-detection task, the model explains the behavior of RT distributions as a function of brightness. For the psychomotor vigilance test, it accounts for lapses in performance under conditions of sleep deprivation and for changes in the shapes of RT distributions over the course of sleep deprivation. The model also successfully maps the rate of accumulation of stimulus information onto independently derived predictions of alertness. The model is a unified, mechanistic account of one-choice RT under conditions of sleep deprivation.},

In this article, we review theoretical positions for and against such competitive parallelism. We then review empirical evidence, primarily drawing on reading time studies, bearing on the prediction made by parallel competitive models that some cost ought to be associated with processing syntactically ambiguous material. We argue that this prediction is not confirmed by the data, and we discuss recent claims that the models in question do not actually make this prediction. We also emphasize the contrast with lexical ambiguity, where there is clearly a processing cost associated with competition between alternate meanings. Finally, we review a different kind of recent evidence suggesting that two syntactic analyses may indeed coexist under specific circumstances. The question of how readers and listeners resolve ambiguities of the sort found in (1)–(3) has been a central topic for psycholinguistic research for the last three decades, because of the light it can shed on how people recognize words and put them together into sentence meanings.},

abstract = {Much recent research has aimed to establish whether visual working memory (WM) is better characterized by a limited number of discrete all-or-none slots or by a continuous sharing of memory resources. To date, however, researchers have not considered the response-time (RT) predictions of discrete-slots versus shared-resources models. To complement the past research in this field, we formalize a family of mixed-state, discrete-slots models for explaining choice and RTs in tasks of visual WM change detection. In the tasks under investigation, a small set of visual items is presented, followed by a test item in 1 of the studied positions for which a change judgment must be made. According to the models, if the studied item in that position is retained in 1 of the discrete slots, then a memory-based evidence-accumulation process determines the choice and the RT; if the studied item in that position is missing, then a guessing-based accumulation process operates. Observed RT distributions are therefore theorized to arise as probabilistic mixtures of the memory-based and guessing distributions. We formalize an analogous set of continuous shared-resources models. The model classes are tested on individual subjects with both qualitative contrasts and quantitative fits to RT-distribution data. The discrete-slots models provide much better qualitative and quantitative accounts of the RT and choice data than do the shared-resources models, although there is some evidence for "slots plus resources" when memory set size is very small.},

abstract = {Psycholinguistic investigations of reanalysis phenomena have typically focused on revisions of phrase structure. Here, we identify a further subcomponent of syntactic reanalysis, namely the revision of case marking. This aspect of reanalysis was isolated by examining German subject-object ambiguities that require a revision towards a dative-initial order. Since dative-initial orders are potentially unmarked, no phrase structure corrections are required, but the original, preference-based nominative assignment must be revised. Experiment 1, an ERP study, revealed an N400 component for reanalysis of case marking, which contrasted with a P600 component for phrase structure revisions. The 'reanalysis N400' was replicated in Experiment 2, which also showed that direct lexical support for a dative-initial order leads to a reduction of the effect. Finally, in Experiment 3, direct time course measures provided by the speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) procedure supported the case reanalysis account by showing that conditions hypothesized to involve case reanalysis (dative-initial structures) require longer computation times than their nominative-initial counterparts. Lexeme-specific support for the dative-initial reading, however, does not lead to a faster computation of the target structure, but rather increases the likelihood that the correct interpretation will be computed. We interpret these findings as evidence for the general availability of an unmarked dative-nominative word order in German, the accessibility of which may be increased by lexical information. Moreover, the data show that syntactic reanalysis is not a homogeneous process, but may rather be subdivided along several dimensions that interact in determining overall garden path strength. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {These studies typically involve the selection of a set of words that vary on some lexical dimension(s). The word list is then presented to a group of participants for the purpose of recording relevant dependent measures (e.g., response time) that serve as the basis of inferences drawn in regard to the processes and structure of the language system. For example, Yates et al. (2004) were interested in how phonological neighborhood density (i.e., the num-ber of words that differ from a target word by one pho-neme) influenced visual word recognition. In each of the experiments reported in their study, a list was constructed composed of an equal number of words with many phono-logical neighbors (high-density words) and words with few neighbors (low-density words). The words were presented along with pronounceable pseudowords in a lexical deci-sion task (i.e., word/nonword discrimination task). Yates et al. found that words with many phonological neighbors were responded to more rapidly on average than words with few neighbors, supporting the notion that phonology is an important component in word processing. Although such studies are relatively simple in design, issues concerning data analysis in this area can be quite contentious. Typically, two analyses are conducted for re-sponse times. In the subjects analysis, or F 1 , condition means are obtained for each subject and submitted to an ANOVA. In the items analysis, or F 2 , condition means are obtained for each item and also submitted to an ANOVA. Obtaining significant treatment effects in both analyses is referred to as meeting the F 1 3 F 2 criterion (Raaijmakers, Schrijnemakers, {\&} Gremmen, 1999). It is commonly be-lieved that if both F 1 and F 2 analyses yield significant find-ings, then the effects will generalize to different samples of subjects and items, assuming that the subjects and items in the experiment can each be considered random samples from larger populations (Raaijmakers et al., 1999). Sim-ply put, under this belief, one can be confident of a given result if both F 1 and F 2 analyses are significant. Although the F 1 3 F 2 criterion is by far the most com-mon approach to data analysis in psycholinguistic stud-ies, there has been some resistance. For example, it is not uncommon to find studies that report F 1 and F 2 analy-ses, but in which conclusions are based primarily on sig-nificant F 1 analyses, ignoring nonsignificant F 2 analyses (e.g., Locker, Simpson, et al., 2003; Siakaluk, Sears, {\&} Lupker, 2002). Although such an approach may be jus-tified under certain conditions (i.e., that item variability has been experimentally controlled; Raaijmakers, 2003; Raaijmakers et al., 1999), Clark (1973) argued in a classic paper that such an approach implicitly assumes that the materials used in an experiment can be treated as fixed factors (i.e., the " language-as-fixed-effect fallacy "). In reality, a given stimulus set of words may constitute only a subset of items that could be utilized in a given},

While studies comparing the attentiveness of participants on MTurk vs traditional subject pool samples provided mixed support for this concern, attention check questions and other methods of ensuring participant attention have become prolific in MTurk studies. Because MTurk is a population that learns, we hypothesized that MTurkers would be more attentive to instructions than traditional subject pool samples. In three online studies, participants from MTurk and collegiate populations participated in a task that included a measure of attentiveness to instructions (an instructional manipulation check – IMC). In all studies, MTurkers were more attentive to instructions than college students, even on novel IMCs (studies 2 and 3), and MTurkers showed larger effects in response to a minute text manipulation. These results have implications for sustainable use of MTurk samples for social science research and the conclusions drawn from research with MTurk and college subject pool samples. Keywords:},

This restriction is unrealistic in light of experimental results suggesting interactions between syntax and other forms of linguistic information in human sentence processing. To address this limitation, this article introduces two sentence processing models that augment a syntactic component with information about discourse co-reference. The novel combination of probabilistic syntactic components with co-reference classifiers permits them to more closely mimic human behavior than existing models. The first model uses a deep model of linguistics, based in part on probabilistic logic, allowing it to make qualitative predictions on experimental data; the second model uses shallow processing to make quantitative predictions on a broad-coverage reading-time corpus.},

In this study, participants heard each target sentence only after the corresponding visual scene had been displayed and then removed. For a scene depicting a man, a woman, a cake, and a newspaper, the eyes were subsequently directed, during 'eat' in 'the man will eat the cake', towards where the cake had previously been located even though the screen had been blank for over 2 s. The rapidity of these movements mirrored the anticipatory eye movements observed in previous studies [Cognition 73 (1999) 247; J. Mem. Lang. 49 (2003) 133]. Thus, anticipatory eye movements are not dependent on a concurrent visual scene, but are dependent on a mental record of the scene that is independent of whether the visual scene is still present.},

Rereading of early material in garden-path reduced relatives should be revisionary, aimed at reanalysing an earlier misparse; however, rereading of early material in a local coherence reduced relative need only be confirmatory, as the original parse of the earlier portion of these sentences is ultimately correct. Results of online and offline measures showed that local coherence structures elicited signals of reading disruption that arose earlier and lasted longer, and local coherence comprehension was also better than garden path comprehension. Few rereading measures in either sentence type were predicted by structural features of these sentences, nor was rereading related to comprehension accuracy, which was extremely low overall.

abstract = {3 4 Agreement attraction errors (such as the number error in the example " The key to the cabinets 5 are rusty ") have been extensively studied in the last twenty years. Two major types of explanation 6 have been suggested: i) attraction arises due to the properties of syntactic structure, because 7 the representation of the subject NP features is faulty or ambiguous; ii) attraction arises because 8 memory retrieval is noisy, and sometimes the wrong NP is selected during dependency resolution. 9 In this article we report the results of four experiments (one on production and three on compreh-10 ension) studying subject-verb gender agreement in Russian. Attraction effects were observed in 11 all of them, which can be more readily explained by the retrieval account (gender, unlike number, 12 is specified for each noun in the lexicon and hence is less likely to be erroneously assigned during 13 structure building). Previous research has shown that number agreement attraction is asymmetric: 14 plural provokes it, but singular does not. Our studies suggest that gender attraction is asymmetric 15 as well; however, the profiles are different in production and comprehension. Moreover, in the 16 comprehension experiments attraction was observed for all dependent noun genders, but only for 17 a subset of head noun genders. This goes against the traditional assumption that the features 18 of the dependent noun are crucial for attraction, showing the features of the head are more 19 important. We show that this approach can be extended to previous findings on attraction and 20 that there exists independent evidence for it.},

Previous individual differences studies found high correlations between working memory (WM) and parameters that characterize the magnitude of the long-RT tail. However, the causal direction remains unknown. In 3 choice-reaction task experiments, we examined this relationship by directly manipulating WM availability. In Experiment 1, the stimulus–response rules were either arbitrary (WM demanding) or nonarbitrary. In Experiment 2, the arbitrary rules were either novel (demanding) or practiced. In Experiment 3, WM was loaded with either declarative (stimulus–stimulus) or procedural (stimulus–response) arbitrary rules. Using an ex-Gaussian model fitting, we found across all experiments that WM demands uniquely influenced the $\tau$ parameter, mostly responsible for the long-RT distribution tail. Evidence accumulation modeling of the choice process indicated that WM load had little influence on the decision process itself and primarily affected the duration of an exponentially distributed nondecision component, assumed to reflect the process of rule retrieval. Theoretical interpretations and implications are discussed.},

However, changes in mean performance (or the lack thereof) may reflect distinct patterns at the level of underlying RT distributions. In seven experiments, RT distributional analyses were used to better understand how distributions change across related and unrelated conditions in standard semantic priming paradigms. In contrast to most other lexical variables, semantic priming in standard conditions simply shifts the RT distribution, implicating a headstart mechanism. However, when targets are degraded, the priming effect increases across the RT distribution, a pattern more consistent with current computational models of semantic priming. Interestingly, priming effects also increase across the RT distribution when targets are degraded and primes are highly masked, supporting a memory retrieval account of priming under degraded conditions. Finally, strengths and limitations of alternative approaches for modeling RT distributions are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

The standard variationist tool — the variable rule program — is a generalized linear model; however, recent developments in statistics have introduced new tools, including mixed-effects models, random forests and conditional infer- ence trees. In a step-by-step demonstration, we show how this well known variable benefits from these complementary techniques. Mixed-effects models provide a principled way of assessing the importance of random-effect factors such as the individuals in the sample. Random forests provide information about the importance of predictors, whether factorial or continuous, and do so also for unbalanced designs with high multicollinearity, cases for which the family of linear models is less appropriate. Conditional inference trees straightforwardly visualize how multiple predictors operate in tandem. Taken together the results confirm that polarity, distance from verb to plural element and the nature of the DP are significant predictors. Ongoing linguistic change and so- cial reallocation via morphologization are operational. Furthermore, the results make predictions that can be tested in future research. We conclude that variationist research can be substantially enriched by an expanded tool kit.},

We explored the reorganization of task architecture with practice by combining interference analysis (delays in dual-task experiment) and random-walk models of decision making (measuring the decision and non-decision contributions to RT). The main delay observed in the Psychologically Refractory Period at short stimulus onset asynchronies (SOA) values was largely unaffected by training. However, the range of SOAs over which this interference regime held diminished with learning. This was consistent with an overall shift observed in single-task performance from a highly variable decision time to a reliable (non-decision time) contribution to response time. Executive components involved in coordinating dual-task performance decreased (and became more stable) after extensive practice. The results suggest that extensive practice reduces the duration of central decision stages, but that the qualitative property of central seriality remains a structural invariant. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Global comparisons showed robust effects of task type with longer fixations and fewer word skippings when letter detection was required. Detailed analyses of target words, however, further showed that reading with and without letter detection yielded virtually identical effects of word class and text predictability for word-skipping rate and similar effects for different word viewing duration measures.

abstract = {Bayesian inference has been advocated as an alternative to conventional analysis in psychological science. Bayesians stress that subjectivity is needed for principled inference, and subjectivity by-and-large has not been seen as desirable. This paper provides the broader rationale and context for subjectivity, and in it we show that subjectivity is the key to principled measures of evidence for theory from data. By making our subjective elements focal, we provide an avenue for common sense and expertise to enter the analysis. We cover the role of models in linking theory to data, the notion that models are abstractions which are neither true nor false, the need for relative model comparison, the role of predictions in stating relative evidence for models, and the role of subjectivity in specifying models that yield predictions. In the end, we conclude that transparent subjectivity leads to a more honest and fruitful analyses in psychological science.},

Women represented 3{\%} of the total sample (n = 21) and 5{\%} (n = 12) of the 256 SBC cases. Therefore, 57{\%} of the women (n = 12) were classified as SBC, and 81{\%} of the women (n = 17) behaviorally evidenced some suicidal motivation. The results underscore that when a female subject becomes involved in a situation leading to an OIS, there is a very high likelihood that she is motivated to be intentionally killed. She is almost guaranteed to have a diagnosed mental disorder, has been prescribed psychiatric medications, and is abusing a substance at the time, most likely alcohol. Nevertheless, she also poses a serious risk of injury to both police officers and civilians during the encounter and will possess a firearm half the time. The wish for suicide is often precipitated by serious relationship issues. Comparisons are made to the male subjects in our previous study.},

This sampling procedure, called the parametric bootstrap cross-fitting method (PBCM; cf. Williams (J. R. Statist. Soc. B 32 (1970) 350; Biometrics 26 (1970) 23)), generates distributions of differences in goodness-of-fit expected under each of the competing models. In the data informed version of the PBCM, the generating models have specific parameter values obtained by fitting the experimental data under consideration. The data informed difference distributions can be compared to the observed difference in goodness-of-fit to allow a quantification of model adequacy. In the data uninformed version of the PBCM, the generating models have a relatively broad range of parameter values based on prior knowledge. Application of both the data informed and the data uninformed PBCM is illustrated with several examples.},

abstract = {While we know a great deal about the dynamics and characteristics of eye movements in relatively simple tasks performed under reduced laboratory conditions, we know less about oculomotor behavior in complex, multi-step tasks. Complex tasks are not necessarily difficult. Part of the transition from 'hard' to 'easy' in completing complex tasks is the gradual reduction in conscious effort required to complete the sub-tasks. We are interested in learning whether high-level perceptual strategies can aid that transition. In the past, subjects performed relatively simple tasks or the eye movements themselves were the instructed task. But outside the laboratory vision is a tool, not the task. To study the oculomotor system in its native mode, we developed a wearable eyetracker that allows natural eye, head and whole-body movements. Using the over-learned, common task of hand-washing, we measured the global characteristics of fixation duration, saccade amplitude, and the spatial distribution of fixation positions. An important observation was the emergence of higher-order perceptual strategies in the complex task: while most fixations were related to the immediate action, a small number of fixations were made to objects relevant only to future actions. Based on a control task that differed only in the high-level goal, we conclude that the look-ahead fixations represent a task-dependent strategy, not a general behavior elicited by the salience or conspicuity of objects in the environment. We propose that the strategy of looking ahead to objects of future relevance supports the conscious percept of an environment seamless in time as well as in space.},

We reanalyzed previous experiments based on lexical-decision and reading-aloud tasks in children with dyslexia and control children and tested the prediction of the difference engine model (DEM) that mean condition reaction times (RTs) and standard deviations (SDs) would be linearly related (Myerson et al., 2003). Then we evaluated the slope and the intercept with the x-axis of these linear functions in comparison with previously reported values (i.e., slope of about 0.30 and intercept of about 300 ms). In the case of lexical decision, the parameters were close to these values; by contrast, in the case of reading aloud, a much steeper slope (0.66) and a greater intercept (482.6 ms) were found. Therefore, interindividual variability grows at a much faster rate as a function of condition difficulty for reading than for lexical-decision tasks (or for other tasks reported in the literature). According to the DEM, the slope of the regression that relates means and SDs indicates the degree of correlation among the durations of the stages of processing. We propose that the need for a close coupling between orthographic and phonological processing in reading is what drives the particularly strong relationship between performance and interindividual variability that we observed in reading tasks.},

Conceptual retrieval was evaluated in three bilingual groups: 10 balanced bilinguals with equal proficiency in Russian (L1) and English (L2); 9 Russian-dominant bilinguals who were less than fully proficient in English (L2); and 7 English-dominant bilinguals for whom English (L2) had become their primary language. Retrieval speed and accuracy was measured for L1 and L2 translation pairs and same- or different-category pairs within and across languages. For all bilinguals, translation pairs engendered higher accuracy and faster retrieval speeds than other conditions, and judgments of same-language category pairs were more accurate than different-language pairs. No differences in speed or accuracy were found for L1 and L2 same-language pairs for the balanced group, indicating that conceptual retrieval was equally proficient in L1 and L2. However, retrieval speed was slower and less accurate for same- and different-language pairs with items from the nondominant language for both unbalanced groups. Slower retrieval speeds are argued to result from a mediational process in which the dominant language provides access to conceptual information whenever mappings in the nondominant language cannot sustain direct retrieval of conceptual information. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

Reaction times were faster for high-frequency words in the blocked, pure-frequency condition than in the mixed-frequency one; medium-frequency words showed less of a difference; and low-frequency words showed no appreciable difference at all. These results corroborate and extend Glanzer and Ehrenreich's (Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 1979, 18, 381-398) empirical results with this paradigm. They strongly imply that changes in decision criteria underlie the reaction time differences Glanzer and Ehrepreich and we found. This evidence places further constraints on theories of lexical access, which may be more easily accomodated by parallel models than by serial ones. Glanzer and Ehrenreich's two-dictionary model is not supported by this data. ?? 1983 Academic Press, Inc.},

This model of the parser is compared with ATN models, and with the two-stage models of Kimball (1973) and Fodor, Bever and Garrett (1974). Our assumption that the units which are shunted from the first stage to the second stage are defined by their length, rather than by their syntactic type, explains the effects of constituent length on perceptual complexity in center embedded sentences and in sentences of the kind that fall under Kimball's principle of Right Association. The particular division of labor between the two parsing units allows us to explain, without appeal to any ad hoc parsing strategies, why the parser makes certain shortsighted errors even though, in general, it is able to make intelligent use of all the information that is available to it.},

abstract = {The last 40 years have witnessed a growing interest in the mechanisms underlying the visual identification of complex words. A large amount of experimental data has been amassed, but although a growing number of studies are proposing explicit theoretical models for their data, no comprehensive theory has gained substantial agreement among scholars in the field. We believe that this is due, at least in part, to the presence of several controversial pieces of evidence in the literature and, consequently, to the lack of a well-defined set of experimental facts that any theory should be able to explain. With this review, we aim to delineate the state of the art in the research on the visual identification of complex words. By reviewing major empirical evidences in a number of different paradigms such as lexical decision, word naming, and masked and unmasked priming, we were able to identify a series of effects that we judge as reliable or that were consistently replicated in different experiments, along with some more controversial data, which we have tried to resolve and explain. We concentrated on behavioral and electrophysiological studies on inflected, derived, and compound words, so as to span over all types of complex words. The outcome of this work is an analytical summary of well-established facts on the most relevant morphological issues, such as regularity, morpheme position coding, family size, semantic transparency, morpheme frequency, suffix allomorphy, and productivity, morphological entropy, and morpho-orthographic parsing. In discussing this set of benchmark effects, we have drawn some methodological considerations on why contrasting evidence might have emerged, and have tried to delineate a target list for the construction of a new all-inclusive model of the visual identification of morphologically complex words.},

This effect was exhibited by first-pass reading times that are usually assumed to reflect initial syntactic commitments. These results are discussed in relation to Frazier and Clifton's recent proposals concerning attachment mechanisms in the case of “non-primary” relationships such as relative clauses, and more precisely the notion that early-closure attachments observed in cross-linguistic studies are determined by relatively late processes.

abstract = {This paper presents the cue-based retrieval theory of parsing and reanalysis and illustrates how this account can accommodate a number of key results about parsing and reanalysis, including effects due to structure, distance, and type of structural change. Three offline experiments and one online experiment permit establishing the locus of these effects as due to properties of the initial parsing processes or to the repair mechanism. Specifically, the data reported here suggest that a structural factor specific to the operation of the parser, retrieval interference, affects attachment uniformly across ambiguous and unambiguous sentences and serves to create a limit on successful repair. In addition, these experiments suggest that distance of the head of an ambiguous phrase from its disambiguator affects repair processes-and not attachment processes-independently of the interference effect. These results are interpreted with respect to alternative models of reanalysis, which are contrasted with the cue-based retrieval account, which requires no distinct repair mechanism to account for the current results. A further contribution of this article is to suggest a statistical correction for individual variance in reading rates. Statistical analyses on individual subject data confirmed previous speculations regarding a possible increase in reading rates as subjects move through a sentence. While this individual variation limits fair comparisons of reading times in sentence regions that appear in non-identical serial positions, we demonstrate that such comparisons become meaningful when the appropriate regression analyses have been performed.},

abstract = {By convention, the term “sentence processing” refers to the subfield of psycholinguistics focusing on the interpretation of sentences. A range of information sources is used for successful sentence processing. Lexical and syntactic constraints are central for defining the structural alternatives, and information associated with the prosody of the sentence as well as the discourse and visual context in which the sentence occurs reinforces some interpretations and fleshes out the meaning of the sentence. Approaches to sentence processing differ regarding whether they assume serial versus parallel and modular versus interactive architectures; almost all assume incremental interpretation and even prediction of structure and lexical content. Current models include the garden-path model, constraint-based models, and approaches that allow the processing system to reduce and even distort the input (Good-Enough Processing; Noisy Channel Models). An important trend is work designed to shed light on how sentence processing is implemented in the brain.},

@article{Lamers:2006p144,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well known that both semantic and syntactic information play a role in pronoun resolution in sentences. However, it is unclear what the relative contribution of these sources of information is for the establishment of a coreferential relationship between the pronoun and the antecedent in combination with a local structural case constraint on the pronoun (i.e. case assignment of a pronoun under preposition governing). In a prepositional phrase in German and Dutch, it is the preposition that assigns case to the pronoun. Furthermore, in these languages different overtly case-marked pronouns are used to refer to male and female persons. Thus, one can manipulate biological/syntactic gender features separately from case marking features. The major aim of this study was to determine what the influence of gender information in combination with a local structural case constraint is on the processing of a personal pronoun in a sentence. Event-related brain potential (ERP) experiments were performed in German and in Dutch. In a word by word sentence reading study in German and Dutch, gender congruency between the antecedent and the pronoun was manipulated and/or case assignment by the preposition was violated while ERPs of young native speakers were recorded. RESULTS: The German and the Dutch ERP data showed an enlarged negativity broadly distributed starting approximately 350 ms after onset of the pronoun followed by a late positivity for gender violations. For syntactic incongruencies without gender violations only a positivity was present. The Dutch data showed an earlier onset of the positivity in comparison to German. CONCLUSION: Finding negativities and positivities for conditions with a gender violation indicates that pronoun resolution with gender incongruency between the pronoun and the antecedent suffers from semantic as well as syntactic integration problems. The presence of a positivity for the syntactically incongruent conditions without gender violations suggests that the processing of incorrect case marking without a gender violation gives rise to syntactic but not semantic integration problems. We suggest that the more prominent case violation in Dutch caused the earlier onset of the positivity in the Dutch study. In addition, the pattern of ERP effects shows that both case and gender information are used almost immediately implying that the local structural constraint affects the resolution process with more processing activity than for a pronoun of which only one source of information is violated or incongruent.},

We contrast a syntactically-represented account whereby people postulate a syntactic representation for the missing argument, with a syntactically-non-represented account whereby people do not postulate any syntactic representation for it. We report two structural priming experiments in Mandarin Chinese that showed that comprehension of a dative sentence with a missing direct-object argument primed the production of a full-form dative sentence (relative to an intransitive) and that it behaved similarly to a corresponding full-form dative sentence. The results suggest that people construct the same constituent structure for missing-argument sentences and full-form sentences, in accord with the syntactically-represented account. We discuss the implications for syntactic representations in language processing.},

abstract = {The past 10 years have brought near-revolutionary changes in psychological theories about short-term memory, with similarly great advances in the neurosciences. Here, we critically examine the major psychological theories (the "mind") of short-term memory and how they relate to evidence about underlying brain mechanisms. We focus on three features that must be addressed by any satisfactory theory of short-term memory. First, we examine the evidence for the architecture of short-term memory, with special attention to questions of capacity and how-or whether-short-term memory can be separated from long-term memory. Second, we ask how the components of that architecture enact processes of encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Third, we describe the debate over the reason about forgetting from short-term memory, whether interference or decay is the cause. We close with a conceptual model tracing the representation of a single item through a short-term memory task, describing the biological mechanisms that might support psychological processes on a moment-by-moment basis as an item is encoded, maintained over a delay with some forgetting, and ultimately retrieved.},

Older participants had reduced working-memory spans compared with younger participants. The on-line measures were sensitive to local increases in processing load, and the off-line measures were sensitive to the syntactic complexity of the sentences. Older and younger participants showed similar effects of syntactic complexity on the on-line measures. There was some evidence that older participants were more affected than younger participants by syntactic complexity on the off-line measures. The results support the hypothesis that on-line processes involved in recognizing linguistic forms and determining the literal, preferred, discourse-coherent meaning of sentences constitute a domain of language processing that relies on its own processing resource or working-memory system.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F 1 and F 2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F 1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

Speeded decisions based on several types of information were examined in 3 experiments, involving, respectively, a line discrimination task, lexical decisions, and an Erikson flanker task. Three levels of SAT were obtained in each experiment by adjusting response deadlines with an adaptive tracking algorithm. Speed stress affected the duration of RT stages both before and after the start of the LRP in all experiments. The latter effect cannot be explained by guessing strategies, by variations in response force, or as an indirect consequence of the pre-LRP effect. Contrary to most models, it suggests that SAT can occur at a late postdecisional stage.},

Most diffusion models assume constant boundaries, which are the threshold levels of evidence that must be sampled from a stimulus to reach a decision. We summarize theoretical results from statistics that relate distributions of decisions and response times to diffusion models with time-varying boundaries. We then develop a computational method for finding time-varying boundaries from empirical data, and apply our new method to two problems. The first problem involves finding the time-varying boundaries that make diffusion models equivalent to the alternative sequential sampling class of accumulator models. The second problem involves finding the time-varying boundaries, at the individual level, that best fit empirical data for perceptual stimuli that provide equal evidence for both decision alternatives. We discuss the theoretical and modeling implications of using time-varying boundaries in diffusion models, as well as the limitations and potential of our approach to their inference.},

abstract = {In research on eye movements in reading, it is common to analyze a number of canonical dependent measures to study how the effects of a manipula-tion unfold over time. Although this gives rise to the well-known multiple comparisons problem, i.e. an inflated probability that the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected (Type I error), it is accepted standard practice not to apply any correction procedures. Instead, there is a widespread belief that corrections are not necessary because the increase in false positives is too small to matter. To our knowledge, no formal argument has ever been presented to justify this assumption. Here, we report a computational investigation of this issue using Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that, contrary to conventional wisdom, false positives are increased to unac-ceptable levels when no corrections are applied. Our simulations also show that counter-measures like the Bonferroni correction keep false positives in check while reducing statistical power only moderately. Hence, there is little reason why such corrections should not be made a standard requirement. Further, we discuss two statistical illusions that can arise when statistical power is too low, and we show how power can be improved to prevent these illusions. In sum, our work renders a detailed picture of the various types of statistical errors than can occur in studies of reading behavior and we give concrete guidance about how these errors can be avoided. A key advantage of using eye-tracking methods in reading research is the wealth of the data that can be collected. The entire sequence of fixations that a participant produces during a trial is recorded and, in theory, available for analysis. In practice, some standard aggregate measures have been established to adequately summarize this wealth of data (Rayner, 1998). Most commonly, the analysis region for which these measures are computed will contain one word or phrase within a longer sentence. Over the last decades, many different measures have been proposed, but there are a handful of standard measures that},

abstract = {The speed-accuracy trade-off (SAT) is a ubiquitous phenomenon in experimental psychology. One popular strategy for controlling SAT is to use the response signal paradigm. This paradigm produces time-accuracy curves (or SAT functions), which can be compared across different experimental conditions. The typical approach to analyzing time-accuracy curves involves the comparison of goodness-of-fit measures (e.g., adjusted-R2), as well as interpretation of point estimates. In this article, we examine the implications of this approach and discuss a number of alternative methods that have been successfully applied in the cognitive modeling literature. These methods include model selection criteria (the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion) and interval estimation procedures (bootstrap and Bayesian). We demonstrate the utility of these methods with a hypothetical data set.},

We tested three hypotheses: the pulse-height noise hypothesis (peak velocity and amplitude vary proportionally), the localization noise hypothesis (variability in amplitude and peak velocity lie along the main sequence), and the independent noise hypothesis (variability in amplitude and peak velocity are independent). We measured eye orientation in two experiments by a scleral coil and a video system. Surprisingly, the main source of variability of saccades depended on the measurement system used. A combination of localization noise and independent noise best describes the data obtained by the video system. The independent noise (e.g., measurement inaccuracy) was the main source of variability. For the scleral coils, the variability was considerably larger than for the less accurate video system. The pulse-height noise hypothesis best describes this additional variability. Therefore we conclude that pulse-height noise is the main source of variability in saccades measured with scleral coils. We discuss the influence of scleral coils on saccade generation and suggest that a change in motor strategy due to the discomfort of wearing the coils might be the cause of the increased variability.},

abstract = {Stochastic diffusion models (Ratcliff, 1978) can be used to analyze response time data from binary decision tasks. They provide detailed information about cognitive processes underlying the performance in such tasks. Most importantly, different parameters are estimated from the response time distributions of correct responses and errors that map (1) the speed of information uptake, (2) the amount of information used to make a decision, (3) possible decision biases, and (4) the duration of nondecisional processes. Although this kind of model can be applied to many experimental paradigms and provides much more insight than the analysis of mean response times can, it is still rarely used in cognitive psychology. In the present paper, we provide comprehensive information on the theory of the diffusion model, as well as on practical issues that have to be considered for implementing the model.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {When participants are asked to respond in the same way to several stimulus identities, responses are often observed to be faster if two stimuli are presented simultaneously as opposed to when a single stimulus is presented (redundant signals effect; Miller, 1982). An important issue of such experiments is whether the observed redundancy gains can be explained by parallel processing of the two stimuli in a race-like fashion. To test the parallel processing model, Miller derived the well-known race model inequality which has become a routine test for behavioral data in experiments with redundant signals. Several statistical procedures have been used for testing the race model inequality. However, the commonly employed procedure does not control the Type I error. In this article a permutation test is described that keeps the Type I error at the desired level. Simulations show that the power of the test is reasonable even for small samples.

Event-related brain potentials (ERP) were recorded while subjects read German subject-object ambiguous relative and complement clauses. As both clause types are initially analyzed as subject-first structures, object-first structures require a revision which is more difficult for complement than for relative clauses. The hypothesis is tested that the revision process consists of two sub-processes, namely diagnosis and actual reanalysis. Applying a spatio-temporal principal component analysis to the ERP data, distinct positive sub-components presumably reflecting different sub-processes could be identified in the time range of the P300 and P600. It will be argued that the P600 is not a monolithic component, and that different sub-processes may be involved at varying time points depending on the type of garden-path sentence.},

The group receiving relative clause experience increased reading speeds for object relatives more than for subject relatives, whereas a control experience group did not.

abstract = {Traditional neuroanatomic models of language comprehension have emphasized a core language network situated in peri-Sylvian cortex. More recent evidence appears to extend the neuroanatomic network beyond peri-Sylvian cortex to encompass other aspects of sentence processing. In this study, we evaluate the neuroanatomic basis for processing the ambiguity in doubly-quantified sentences. For example, a sentence like "All the dogs jumped in a lake" can be interpreted with a collective interpretation (e.g., several dogs jumping into a single lake) or a distributive interpretation (e.g., several dogs each jumping into a different lake). In Experiment 1, we used BOLD fMRI to investigate neuroanatomic recruitment by young adults during the interpretation of ambiguous doubly-quantified sentences in a sentence-picture verification task. We observed that young adults exhibited a processing cost associated with interpreting ambiguous sentences and this was related to frontal and parietal cortex recruitment. In Experiment 2, we investigate ambiguous sentence processing with the identical materials in non-aphasic patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) who have frontal cortex disease and executive and decision-making limitations. bvFTD patients are insensitive to ambiguity associated with doubly-quantified sentences, and this is related to the magnitude of their frontal cortex disease. These studies provide converging evidence that cortical regions that extend beyond peri-Sylvian cortex help support the processing costs associated with the interpretation of ambiguous doubly-quantified sentences.},

This difference was reversed when impersonal pronouns constituted the embedded noun phrase. This pattern of distribution provides a suitable framework for testing the role of experience in sentence processing: if frequency of exposure influences processing difficulty, highly frequent pronominal object relatives should be easier to process but only when a personal pronoun is in the embedded position. We tested this hypothesis experimentally: We conducted four self-paced reading tasks, which indicated that differences in pronominal object/subject relative processing mirrored the pattern of distribution revealed by the corpus analysis. We discuss the results in the light of current theories of sentence comprehension. We conclude that object relative processing is facilitated by frequency of the embedded clause, and, more generally, that statistical information should be taken into account by theories of relative clause processing. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A strong claim about human sentence comprehension is that the processing
mechanism is fully innate and applies differently to different languages
only to the extent that their grammars differ. If so, there is hope
for an explanatory project which attributes all parsing “strategies”
to fundamental design characteristics of the parsing device. However,
the whole explanatory program is in peril because of the discovery
(Cuetos {\&} Mitchell, 1988) that Late Closure is not universal: Spanish,
and also Dutch and other languages, favor Early Closure (high attachment)
where English favors Late Closure flow attachment). I argue that
the universal parser can weather this storm. Exceptions to Late Closure
in Spanish and other languages are observed only in one construction
(a relative clause attaching into a complex noun phrase [NP]), which
is borderline in English too. For other constructions, low attachment
is preferred in all languages tested. I propose that what differentiates
the complex NP construction is the heaviness of the attachee compared
to that of the host configuration. A relative clause is a heavy attachee,
and the lower NP alone is small as a host; the relative is therefore
better balanced if the whole complex NP is its host. A wide range
of facts is accounted for by the principle that a constituent likes
to have a sister of its own size. Light constituents will tend to
attach low, and heavy ones to attach high, since larger constituents
are dominated by higher nodes. A preference for balanced weight is
familiar from work on prosodic phrasing. I suggest, therefore, that
prosodic processing occurs in parallel with syntactic processing
(even in reading) and influences structural ambiguity resolution.
Height of attachment ambiguities are resolved by the prosodically
motivated same-size-sister constraint. The exceptional behavior of
English may be due to its prosodic packaging of a relative pronoun
with the adjacent noun, overriding the balance tendency. If this
explanation is correct, it is possible that all cross-language variations
in parsing preferences are due to cross-language variations in the
prosodic component of the competence grammar.ER -},

abstract = {The book presents recent developments in the field of correlated data
analysis. Its aim is to give a systematic account of regression models
and their application to the modelling and analysis of correlated
data. Longitudinal data have been used for the development and illustration
of the methodologies. In addition to marginal models and mixed-effects
models, the book covers topics on joint regression analysis, on Gaussian
copulas and generalised state space models for longitudinal data
from long time series. Various real-world data examples, numerical
illustrations and software usage tips are presented throughout the
book, making it suitable for graduate courses on correlated data
analysis. The book places also emphasis on some recent developments
on correlated data analysis as well as on the technical details of
the theory and methodology underlying the related software applications.
Thus, it may also serve as a reference for those that need theoretical
explanations and a deeper understanding of the theory that underlies
the related analyses. The book is structured in 13 chapters. Chapter
1 provides an introduction to the subject matter, including some
examples of the data types treated by correlated analysis. Chapter
2 is devoted to a review of the theory of dispersion models, while
Chapter 3 gives a systematic treatment for the theory of inference
functions. Chapter 4 provides a general discussion on strategies
for modelling correlated data, and introduces several methods to
simulate correlated data that are essential in simulation studies.
Chapters 5 and 6 are devoted to the marginal and vector generalised
linear models, respectively, while Chapters 7 ad 8 are devoted to
the mixed-effects models, another class of models for the analysis
of correlated data, focusing on likelihood-based and Bayesian methods
for inference, respectively. Chapter 9 is devoted to the best linear
unbiased predictor, while Chapters 10, 11, and 12 discuss generalised
state space models and their application to longitudinal binomial
and count data. Finally, Chapter 13 is devoted to another topic that
is highly relevant to the analysis of correlated data and concerns
the missing data problem arising particularly from longitudinal data.},

abstract = {Psychological theories are statements of constraint. The role of hypothesis testing in psychology is to test whether specific theoretical constraints hold in data. Bayesian statistics is well suited to the task of finding supporting evidence for constraint, because it allows for comparing evidence for 2 hypotheses against each another. One issue in hypothesis testing is that constraints may hold only approximately rather than exactly, and the reason for small deviations may be trivial or uninteresting. In the large-sample limit, these uninteresting, small deviations lead to the rejection of a useful constraint. In this article, we develop several Bayes factor 1-sample tests for the assessment of approximate equality and ordinal constraints. In these tests, the null hypothesis covers a small interval of non-0 but negligible effect sizes around 0. These Bayes factors are alternatives to previously developed Bayes factors, which do not allow for interval null hypotheses, and may especially prove useful to researchers who use statistical equivalence testing. To facilitate adoption of these Bayes factor tests, we provide easy-to-use software.},

Most previous studies concluded that quantifiers do not immediately influence how a sentence is understood based on the observation that online N400-effects differed from offline plausibility judgments. Those studies, however, used serial visual presentation (SVP), which involves unnatural reading. In the current ERP-experiment, we presented spoken positive and negative quantifier sentences (“Practically all/practically no postmen prefer delivering mail, when the weather is good/bad during the day”). Different from results obtained in a previously reported SVP-study (Nieuwland, 2016) sentence truth-value N400 effects occurred in positive and negative quantifier sentences alike, reflecting fully incremental quantifier comprehension. This suggests that the prosodic information available during spoken language comprehension supports the generation of online predictions for upcoming words and that, at least for quantifier sentences, comprehension of spoken language may proceed more incrementally than comprehension during SVP reading.},

abstract = {This article reviews the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in model selection and the appraisal of psychological theory. The focus is on latent variable models, given their growing use in theory testing and construction. Theoretical statistical results in regression are discussed, and more important issues are illustrated with novel simulations involving latent variable models including factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and factor mixture models. Asymptotically, the BIC is consistent, in that it will select the true model if, among other assumptions, the true model is among the candidate models considered. The AIC is not consistent under these circumstances. When the true model is not in the candidate model set the AIC is efficient, in that it will asymptotically choose whichever model minimizes the mean squared error of prediction/estimation. The BIC is not efficient under these circumstances. Unlike the BIC, the AIC also has a minimax property, in that it can minimize the maximum possible risk in finite sample sizes. In sum, the AIC and BIC have quite different properties that require different assumptions, and applied researchers and methodologists alike will benefit from improved understanding of the asymptotic and finite-sample behavior of these criteria. The ultimate decision to use the AIC or BIC depends on many factors, including the loss function employed, the study's methodological design, the substantive research question, and the notion of a true model and its applicability to the study at hand.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the processing of long-distance filler-gap dependencies in Japanese, a strongly head-final language. Two self-paced reading experiments and one sentence completion study show that Japanese readers associate a fronted wh -phrase with the most deeply embedded clause of a multi-clause sentence. Experiment 1 demonstrates this using evidence that readers expect to encounter a scope-marking affix on the verb of an embedded clause in wh -fronting constructions. Experiment 2 shows that the wh -phrase is already associated with the embedded clause before the embedded verb is processed, based on a Japanese counterpart of the Filled Gap Effect (Stowe, 1986). Experiment 3 corroborates these findings in a sentence completion study. These findings clarify the factors responsible for 'active filler' effects in processing long-distance dependencies (Crain {\&} Fodor, 1985; Fodor, 1978; Frazier {\&} Clifton, 1989; Stowe, 1986) in ways not possible in head-initial languages. The results provide evidence that the processing of filler-gap dependencies is driven by the need to satisfy thematic role requirements of the fronted phrase, rather than by the need to create a gap as soon as possible. The paper also discusses implications of these findings for theories of reanalysis. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@phdthesis{Dillon:2011,
abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the nature of memory access during the construction of long-distance dependencies in online sentence comprehension. In recent years, an intense focus on the computational challenges posed by long-distance dependencies has proven to be illuminating with respect to the characteristics of the architecture of the human sentence processor, suggesting a tight link between general memory access procedures and sentence processing routines (Lewis {\&} Vasishth 2005; Lewis, Vasishth, {\&} Van Dyke 2006; Wagers, Lau {\&} Phillips 2009). The present thesis builds upon this line of research, and its primary aim is to motivate and defend the hypothesis that the parser accesses linguistic memory in an essentially structured fashion for certain long-distance dependencies. In order to make this case, I focus on the processing of reflexive and agreement dependencies, and ask whether or not non- structural information such as morphological features are used to gate memory access during syntactic comprehension. Evidence from eight experiments in a range of methodologies in English and Chinese is brought to bear on this question, providing arguments from interference effects and time-course effects that primarily syntactic information is used to access linguistic memory in the construction of certain long- distance dependencies. The experimental evidence for structured access is compatible with a variety of architectural assumptions about the parser, and I present one implementation of this idea in a parser based on the ACT-R memory architecture. In the context of such a content-addressable model of memory, the claim of structured access is equivalent to the claim that only syntactic cues are used to query memory. I argue that structured access reflects an optimal parsing strategy in the context of a noisy, interference-prone cognitive architecture: abstract structural cues are favored over lexical feature cues for certain structural dependencies in order to minimize memory interference in online processing.},

abstract = {When we read or listen to language, we are faced with the challenge of inferring intended messages from noisy input. This challenge is exacerbated by considerable variability between and within speakers. Focusing on syntactic processing (parsing), we test the hypothesis that language comprehenders rapidly adapt to the syntactic statistics of novel linguistic environments (e.g., speakers or genres). Two self-paced reading experiments investigate changes in readers' syntactic expectations based on repeated exposure to sentences with temporary syntactic ambiguities (so-called “garden path sentences”). These sentences typically lead to a clear expectation violation signature when the temporary ambiguity is resolved to an a priori less expected structure (e.g., based on the statistics of the lexical context). We find that comprehenders rapidly adapt their syntactic expectations to converge towards the local statistics of novel environments. Specifically, repeated exposure to a priori unexpected structures can reduce, and even completely undo, their processing disadvantage (Experiment 1). The opposite is also observed: a priori expected structures become less expected (even eliciting garden paths) in environments where they are hardly ever observed (Experiment 2). Our findings suggest that, when changes in syntactic statistics are to be expected (e.g., when entering a novel environment), comprehenders can rapidly adapt their expectations, thereby overcoming the processing disadvantage that mistaken expectations would otherwise cause. Our findings take a step towards unifying insights from research in expectation-based models of language processing, syntactic priming, and statistical learning.},

two types of linguistic dependencies, namely NPI licensing and the binding of reflexive anaphors like himself, and herself


Intrusion occurs when speakers retrieve non-target or structurally inappro- priate items that share some measure of similarity with the appro- priate target.


Badecker and Straub (2002) and Kennison (2003) have found that inaccessible antecedents exerted an influence on the resolution of reflexives and pronouns.


previous studies have investigated intrusion effects in very different constructions, such as wh-questions, pronoun binding, subject-verb agreement, and licensing of negative polarity items (NPIs) such as any, ever, or lift a finger


At first glance NPI licensing shares important commonalities with the processing of anaphora, and with reflexives in particular. Both phenomena typically require a licensor in a structurally appropriate position.


the human parser can use structural constraints to guide its operations


a number of studies indicate that when completing a wh-dependency, com- prehenders are sensitive to island constraints, such that the well-known `active' gap construction mechanisms are inoperative in domains that span island boundaries (e.g., Phillips, 2006; Stowe, 1986; Traxler {\{}{\&}{\}} Pickering, 1996)


A particularly relevant example for this study is an eye-tracking study by Sturt (2003) on the processing of reflexives like himself and herself, which demonstrated a retrieval mechanism that appears to immediately respect grammatical constraints on antecedents for reflexives.


responses in the inaccessible licensor condition were both slower and less accurate than in the other two conditions


an N400 component was elicited in both ungrammatical conditions


Vasishth et al. (2008) demonstrated faster reading times for sentences with an intrusive licensor than for sentences with no licensor, but only in later reading time measures such as second pass fixations.


Vasishth, Lewis and their col- leagues (Lewis, Vasishth, {\{}{\&}{\}} Van Dyke, 2006; Vasishth, Drenhaus, Saddy, {\{}{\&}{\}} Lewis, 2005) have argued that the intrusion effect in NPI licensing reflects a general cue-based memory retrieval mechanism that is sensitive to partial cue overlap


(7a) shows that when an NPI is within the semantic scope of a negation, it can be licensed, even though it is not syntactically c-commanded by the negation. (7b) shows that the same is not true of reflexive binding, which requires the antecedent to c-command the reflexive.


There is a broad consensus among current leading theories of neg- ative polarity phenomena that NPI licensing reflects an interaction between the lexical properties of NPIs and the semantics and prag- matics of entire propositions (e.g., Chierchia, 2006; Fauconnier, 1975; Giannakidou, 1998; Israel, 2004; Kadmon {\{}{\&}{\}} Landman, 1993; Krifka, 1995; Ladusaw, 1992), rather than a direct structural relation between the NPI and a licensing item.


much work in linguistics suggests that NPI licensing and reflexive binding involve substantially different relations. Specifically, whereas reflexive binding involves depen- dencies between two specific syntactic constituents, many stud- ies of NPI licensing have concluded that NPIs are licensed by the semantics and pragmatics of entire propositions, rather than involving dependencies with specific lexical items.


Since the reflexive binding relation is more easily classified as an item-to-item dependency it may be a better candidate for testing the predictions of a retrieval-based model such as ACT-R.


The contrasting findings about NPI licensing and reference resolution may reflect the different methodologies that have been used across studies, or they may reflect fundamental differences in the two phenomena


In this study, we compared the intrusion effect on NPI licensing and reflexive binding in the same structural configurations and in the same experiment, using ERP recordings, which offer a fine-grained and continuous measure of brain activity.


two types of unac- ceptable sentence. The first type of unacceptable sentence con- tained no potential licensor for the NPI or reflexive, and the second type of unacceptable sentence contained a potential licen- sor in a structurally inappropriate position


The two intrusive conditions included the same potential NPI licensors, but in the subject position of the relative clause.


if the intrusive licensing effect appears in the ERP re- cord as soon as any effect of ungrammaticality, then we may con- clude that intrusion impedes the ability of speakers to detect grammatical errors, making a true `illusion of grammaticality'


Since overt negation is a stereotypical licensor for NPIs, it is possible that intrusive licensing might reflect the high cooccurrence frequency between no and ever.


Previous studies have shown that gender-stereo- typed nouns cause comprehender to make an early commitment to the gender of the referent, and that this commitment is strong en- ough to cause processing disruption upon reading a mismatching reflexive (Osterhout, Bersick, {\{}{\&}{\}} McLaughlin, 1997; Sturt, 2003).


Among the 210 filler items, 150 had similar structures and used similar determiners to the NPI con- ditions, but without the NPI ever.


with the gender stereotype of the main clause subject. In the two unacceptable conditions the reflexive violated the gender stereo- type of the main clause subject (e.g., The butcher burnt herself).


although the NPI materials and reflexive materials were structurally parallel, they were not lexically matched

a 200 ms pre-stimulus baseline correction


A 10 Hz low-pass filter was applied to the grand average ERPs for presentation purposes, however all analyses were performed on unfiltered data.


six regions of interest (ROIs) were ini- tially defined, consisting of three electrodes at each ROI: left ante- rior (FT7, F3, FC3), midline anterior (FZ, FCZ, CZ), right anterior (F4, FC4, FT8), left posterior (TP7, CP3, P3), midline posterior (CPZ, PZ, OZ), and right posterior (CP4, P4, TP8)


No statistical analyses revealed significant main effects or interactions involving the laterality factor, and so this factor was removed from further analysis.


significant main effect of condition at the 200--400 ms interval and the 600--800 ms interval, and a marginally significant effect of condition at the 800--1000 ms interval


the ungrammatical no licensor condition elicited a P600 relative to each of the two grammatical control conditions


ungrammatical intrusive licensor conditions did not elicit a signif- icant P600 effect relative to the grammatical conditions


a broadly dis- tributed negativity in the intrusive licensor conditions


In order to evaluate the possible impact of the early negativity on the critical P600 effect we conducted a further set of ANOVA analyses based on a 200 ms post-stimulus baseline interval.


the negativity was present already in the 0--200 ms interval, earlier even than reports of the ELAN com- ponent elicited by word category violations (Friederici et al., 1993; Hahne {\{}{\&}{\}} Friederici, 1999; Neville et al., 1991)


Since the two different baselines did not impact the overall pattern of P600 effects, we conclude that the intrusion effect seen in the P600 is a genuine reflection of processing the NPI ever.


presentation of a negative polarity item in the ab- sence of a preceding licensor elicited a P600-like component, rela- tive to grammatical control conditions in which the NPI was licensed by a c-commanding NP containing no or very few


this P600 effect was either absent or substantially attenuated in ungrammatical sen- tences where the NPI was preceded by a non-c-commanding po- tential licensor


there was no delay between the onset of the gram- maticality effect and the onset of the effect of intrusive licensing


Our analyses found no evidence to suggest that intrusive licensing effects differ as a func- tion of licensor type.


This pattern of results is consistent with the interpretation that NPI intrusion effects reflect an immediate illusion of grammaticality, rather than the result of a later process initiated after detection of an anomaly.


Analysis of the ERPs for the reflexive conditions revealed a pos- terior positivity with an onset at around 400 ms in both the intru- sive and the incongruent conditions. This resembles the P600 component found in previous studies of reflexive violations


no differences between the incongruent and intrusive antecedent conditions


if this trend reflects a real dif- ference, it might be interpreted as a late intrusion effect


The ab- sence of a suitable antecedent/licensor led to a P600 effect in both cases, but the effect of the intrusive licensor/antecedent was not the same for reflexives and NPIs.


the intrusive licen- sor in some way disrupts the earliest stages of grammaticality detection for NPIs


intrusive antecedents do not impact the initial stages of reflexive binding in the same way that intru- sive licensors do for NPIs


The immediate constituents of each clause could be marked with a clause index that encodes which clause the constit- uent is a part of, expanding on the binary distinction between embedded and non-embedded clauses used in existing versions of the model.


The contrast between reflexives and NPIs presents a challenge for any theory that assumes (i) that NPI intrusion effect is the consequence of general-purpose retrieval mechanisms, and (ii) that reflexive binding and NPI licensing reflect similar item-to-item structural dependencies.


reflexive binding entails retrieval of an antecedent, whereas the semantic/pragmatic account of NPIs predicts that NPI licensing does not entail retrieval of a licensor.


Current leading accounts of negative polarity claim that the licensing condition results from an interaction between the lexical semantic features of NPIs and the semantic and pragmatic proper- ties of the linguistic environments that host the NPIs.


The role of negative implicatures provides a way to account for contrasts between pairs of sentences like I am surprised that we have any sugar. vs. ?I am sure we have any sugar (modified from Linebarger, 1987).


the lexical meanings of NPIs correspond to extreme values along a scale of contextually deter- mined alternatives


NPIs have the pragmatic effect of strengthening the statements that they occur in, and hence a successful licensing environment must have the property that the NPIs inclusion leads to a strengthened statement.


Restrictive relative clauses that contain negative quantifiers may be particularly prone to errone- ous implicatures.


comprehenders are sensitive to the contrastive function of restrictive modifiers, and can use the presence of a restrictive modifier to rapidly infer an intended contrast, e.g., the expression the tall cup implies a contrast with a non-tall cup (Altmann {\{}{\&}{\}} Steedman, 1988; Sedivy, Tanenhaus, Chambers, {\{}{\&}{\}} Carlson, 1999; Tanenhaus, Spivey- Knowlton, Eberhard, {\{}{\&}{\}} Sedivy, 1995)


Fischler and colleagues found no N400 difference to the final word in A robin is a bird and A robin is not a bird, but did observe a larger N400 in sentences with the- matically unrelated target words, such as A robin is not a vehicle (Fischler, Bloom, Childers, Roucos, {\{}{\&}{\}} Perry, 1983; see also Kounios {\{}{\&}{\}} Holcomb, 1992; Noveck {\{}{\&}{\}} Posada, 2003).


Although the factors that determine whether a negative inference is generated are not well under- stood, we suggest that speakers may be more likely to generate such inferences if the contrasting referents are made very salient in the discourse. Negative quantifiers can do exactly this.


NPI licensing may have more in common with the types of structural relations that are characteristically associated with the P600.


it has been suggested that this P600 reflects monitoring processes triggered when a comprehen- der detects uncertainty over syntax-semantics compatibility


the P600 elicited by unlicensed NPIs may correspond to two tempo- rally distinct components, which they associate with diagnosis and reanalysis, respectively (Drenhaus et al., 2006; see also Fried- erici, Mecklinger, Spencer, Steinhauer, {\{}{\&}{\}} Donchin, 2001)


Vasishth and colleagues attri- bute intrusive licensing to partial cue matching during retrieval of a licensor for the NPI, thereby treating the effect as representa- tive of a far broader phenomenon.


the presence of spurious pragmatic inferences may create immediate illusions of acceptability for NPIs, thus making error detection and reanalysis less likely.


our account does not involve specific retrieval of a licensor, and it depends on pragmatic infer- ences that are generated in specific contexts


Our ac- count is therefore consistent with the contrasting results in the NPI licensing and reflexive binding conditions in the current exper- iment, but many further tests will be required in order to deter- mine the generality of intrusive licensing effects.


ERP recordings demonstrated a robust electrophysiological correlate of intrusion effects for NPI licensing, in the form of a reduction in the P600 elicited by ungrammatical NPIs. But no corresponding modulation of the P600 was observed for reflexive binding, where syntactic con- straints appeared to prevent intrusive antecedents from influenc- ing the initial stages of anaphor resolution.


the kinds of semantic processes indexed by the N400 are probably different from the semantic processes involved in NPI licensing},

On the basis of data from the ICE-GB corpus, I analyze two different pairs of syntactic patterns, the so-called dative alternation and particle placement of transitive phrasal verbs. Although it has sometimes been argued that only experimental data can contribute to studies of priming, the analysis shows that (a) the corpus-based results for datives are very similar to the experimental ones; (b) priming is also obtained for the verb-particle construction, a construction hitherto not explored in the priming literature and (c), most importantly, in line with much previous psycholinguistic and corpus-linguistic work, priming effects turn out to be strongly verb-specific such that some verbs are much more resistant or responsive to priming than others. I conclude with a discussion of how corpus data relate to experimental data and how the corpus-based findings can contribute to psycholinguistic model building.},

abstract = {In two visual ERP studies, we investigated whether Mandarin Chinese shows a subject-preference in spite of the controversial status of grammatical relations in this language. We compared ERP responses at the position of the verb and the second NP in object-verb-subject (OVS) and subject-verb-object (SVO) structures. While SVO is the basic word order in Chinese and OV with subject-drop is possible, OVS is strongly dispreferred. At the position of the verb, which disambiguated towards an object or a subject reading of NP1, Experiment 1 revealed an N400 for both subject-initial control conditions in comparison with the critical object-initial condition. Experiment 2 showed that this result was due to differences in lexical-semantic relatedness between NP1 and the verb. When these were controlled for, we observed an N400 for the disambiguation towards an object-initial order, i.e., evidence for a subject-preference. At the postverbal NP, the object-initial condition showed a biphasic N400-late positivity pattern in both experiments. We interpret the N400 as reflecting the processing of an unexpected argument and the late positivity as a correlate of a well-formedness mismatch. Overall, our results suggest that Mandarin Chinese shows a subject-preference for an initial argument, thus providing further converging support for the notion that the subject-preference might constitute a universal processing strategy. We argue that the functional basis for this strategy lies in cross-linguistically applicable economy principles that serve to constrain incremental interpretation.},

Consistent with previous results from Wotschack and Kliegl, the question difficulty manipulation influenced the probability of regressing from late in sentences and re-reading earlier regions; readers who expected difficult comprehension questions were more likely to re-read. However, this manipulation had no reliable influence on eye movements during first-pass reading of earlier sentence regions. Moreover, for the subset of sentences that contained a plausibility manipulation, the disruption induced by implausibility was not modulated by the question manipulation. We interpret these results as suggesting that comprehension demands influence reading behavior primarily by modulating a criterion for comprehension that readers apply after completing first-pass processing.},

Our results show that DLT integration cost is not a significant predictor of reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. However, DLT successfully predicts reading times for nouns. We also find evidence for integration cost effects at auxiliaries, not predicted by DLT. For surprisal, we demonstrate that an unlexicalized formulation of surprisal can predict reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus. Comparing DLT integration cost and surprisal, we find that the two measures are uncorrelated, which suggests that a complete theory will need to incorporate both aspects of processing complexity. We conclude that eye-tracking corpora, which provide reading time data for naturally occurring, contextualized sentences, can complement experimental evidence as a basis for theories of processing complexity.},

@article{Phillips2014,
abstract = {This article reviews studies that have used experimental methods from psycholinguistics to address questions about the representation of sentences involving ellipsis. Accounts of the structure of ellipsis can be classified based on three choice points in a decision tree. First: does the identity constraint between antecedents and ellipsis sites apply to syntactic or semantic representations? Second: does the ellipsis site contain a phonologically null copy of the structure of the antecedent, or does it contain a pronoun or pointer that lacks internal structure? Third: if there is unpronounced structure at the ellipsis site, does that structure participate in all syntactic processes, or does it behave as if it is genuinely absent at some levels of syntactic representation? Experimental studies on ellipsis have begun to address the first two of these questions, but they are unlikely to provide insights on the third question, since the theoretical contrasts do not clearly map onto timing predictions. Some of the findings that are emerging in studies on ellipsis resemble findings from earlier studies on other syntactic dependencies involving wh-movement or anaphora. Care should be taken to avoid drawing conclusions from experiments about ellipsis that are known to be unwarranted in experiments about these other dependencies.},

abstract = {Cue-based memory retrieval models have come to dominate theories of how linguistic dependencies such as subject-verb agreement are formed in comprehension. A cornerstone of the arguments in favor of such models is the grammaticality asymmetry in agreement attraction—the observation that non-subject noun phrases may interfere with the computation of agreement in ungrammatical, but not grammatical, sentences. This asymmetry is most often accounted for via the interaction of categorical number marking and the dynamics of retrieval interference. In the present paper, we challenge this interpretation of the grammaticality asymmetry, and instead argue that it is an artifact of response bias. In three forced-choice judgment experiments, we show that neutralizing response bias eliminates the grammaticality asymmetry in speeded acceptability judgments. We argue that this finding, together with the response time patterns in our experiments, favors an account that attributes attraction effects to a continuous representation of number, rather than to the dynamics of cue-based retrieval. We implement a model of grammaticality judgments, which links the continuous representation of subject number to the rate of evidence accumulation in a diffusion process. This model accounts for the presence or absence of the grammaticality asymmetry through shifts in the decisional starting point (i.e. response bias). The results have implications for the representation of number in language production and comprehension, the role of memory in the processing of linguistic dependencies, and highlight the importance of monitoring for response bias effects in judgment tasks.},

In our experiment, participants read part of a sentence ending in a high- or low-frequency target word and then made a long (40 degrees) or short (10 degrees) saccade to the rest of the sentence. We found a frequency effect on the target word and the first word after the saccade, but the effect was greater for short than for long saccades. Readers therefore performed more lexical processing during long saccades than during short ones. Hence, lexical processing takes place during saccades in text comprehension.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce some mathematical and numerical tools to
analyze and interpret inhomogeneous quadratic forms. The resulting
characterization is in some aspects similar to that given by experimental
studies of cortical cells, making it particularly suitable for application
to second-order approximations and theoretical models of physiological
receptive fields. We first discuss two ways of analyzing a quadratic
form by visualizing the coefficients of its quadratic and linear
term directly and by considering the eigenvectors of its quadratic
term. We then present an algorithm to compute the optimal excitatory
and inhibitory stimuli, i.e. the stimuli that maximize and minimize
the considered quadratic form, respectively, given a fixed energy
constraint. The analysis of the optimal stimuli is completed by considering
their invariances, which are the transformations to which the quadratic
form is most insensitive. We introduce a test to determine which
of these are statistically significant. Next we propose a way to
measure the relative contribution of the quadratic and linear term
to the total output of the quadratic form. Furthermore, we derive
simpler versions of the above techniques in the special case of a
quadratic form without linear term and discuss the analysis of such
functions in previous theoretical and experimental studies. In the
final part of the paper we show that for each quadratic form it is
possible to build an equivalent two-layer neural network, which is
compatible with (but more general than) related networks used in
some recent papers and with the energy model of complex cells. We
show that the neural network is unique only up to an arbitrary orthogonal
transformation of the excitatory and inhibitory subunits in the first
layer. },

abstract = {Memory is fleeting. New material rapidly obliterates previous material. How then can the brain deal successfully with the continual deluge of linguistic input? We argue that, to deal with this "Now-or-Never" bottleneck, the brain must compress and recode linguistic input as rapidly as possible. This observation has strong implications for the nature of language processing: (i) the language system must "eagerly" recode and compress linguistic input; (ii) as the bottleneck recurs at each new representational level, the language system must build a multi-level linguistic representation; and (iii) it must deploy all available information predictively to ensure that local linguistic ambiguities are dealt with "Right-First-Time;" once the original input is lost, there is no way for the language system to recover. This is "Chunk-and-Pass" processing. Similarly, language learning must also occur in the here-and-now. This implies that language acquisition is learning to process, rather than inducing a grammar. Moreover, this perspective provides a cognitive foundation for grammaticalization and other aspects of language change. Chunk-and-Pass processing also helps explain a variety of core properties of language, including its multi-level representational structure and duality of patterning. This approach promises to create a direct relationship between psycholinguistics and linguistic theory. More generally, we outline a framework within which to integrate often disconnected inquiries into language processing, language acquisition, and language change and evolution.},

However, Desmet et al. did not provide direct evidence in favour of tuning, because their study focused on production and did not include reading experiments. In the present paper this line of research was extended. A corpus analysis and an eye-tracking experiment revealed that when taking into account lexical properties of the NP host sites (i.e., animacy and concreteness) the frequency pattern and the on-line comprehension of the relative clause attachment ambiguity do correspond.

In this paper we revisit this topic, arguing that there are two qualitatively different ways in which a Bayesian model could be constructed. If a Bayesian model is intended to license a claim about optimality then the priors and likelihoods in the model must be constrained by reference to some external criterion. A descriptive Bayesian model need not correspond to any claim that the underlying cognition is optimal or rational, and is used solely as a tool for instantiating a substantive psychological theory. We present three case studies in which these two perspectives lead to different computational models and license different conclusions about human cognition. We argue that the descriptive Bayesian approach is more useful overall, especially when combined with principled tools for model evaluation and model selection. More generally we argue for the importance of making a clear distinction between the two perspectives. Considerable confusion results when descriptive models and optimal models are conflated, and if Bayesians are to avoid contributing to this confusion it is important to avoid making normative claims when none are intended.},

What is not known is how listeners build these talker-specific distributions; that is, if they aggregate all information received over a certain time period, or if they rely more heavily upon the most recent information received and down-weight older, consolidated information. In the present experiment, listeners were exposed to four interleaved blocks of a lexical decision task and a phonetic categorization task in which the lexical decision blocks were designed to bias perception in opposite directions along a “s”–“sh” continuum. Listeners returned several days later and completed the identical task again. Evidence was consistent with listeners using a relatively short temporal window of integration at the individual session level. Namely, in each individual session, listeners' perception of a “s”–“sh” contrast was biased by the information in the immediately preceding lexical decision block, and there was no evidence that listeners summed their experience with the talker over the entire session. Similarly, the magnitude of the bias effect did not change between sessions, consistent with the idea that talker-specific information remains flexible, even after consolidation. In general, results suggest that listeners are maximally flexible when considering how to categorize speech from a novel talker.},

abstract = {In the generative tradition, the language faculty has been shrinking—perhaps to include only the mechanism of recursion. This paper argues that even this view of the language faculty is too expansive. We first argue that a language faculty is difficult to reconcile with evolutionary considerations. We then focus on recursion as a detailed case study, arguing that our ability to process recursive structure does not rely on recursion as a property of the grammar, but instead emerge gradually by piggybacking on domain-general sequence learning abilities. Evidence from genetics, comparative work on non-human primates, and cognitive neuroscience suggests that humans have evolved complex sequence learning skills, which were subsequently pressed into service to accommodate language. Constraints on sequence learning therefore have played an important role in shaping the cultural evolution of linguistic structure, including our limited abilities for processing recursive structure. Finally, we re-evaluate some of the key considerations that have often been taken to require the postulation of a language faculty.},

Sequential-sampling models like the diffusion model have a long history in psychology. They view decision making as a process of noisy accumulation of evidence from a stimulus. The standard model assumes that evidence accumulates at a constant rate during the second or two it takes to make a decision. This process can be linked to the behaviors of populations of neurons and to theories of optimality. Diffusion models have been used successfully in a range of cognitive tasks and as psychometric tools in clinical research to examine individual differences. In this review, we relate the models to both earlier and more recent research in psychology.},

abstract = {Pointing tasks in human-computer interaction obey certain speed-accuracy tradeoff rules. In general, the more accurate the task to be accomplished, the longer it takes and vice versa. Fitts' law models the speed-accuracy tradeoff effect in pointing as imposed by the task parameters, through Fitts' index of difficulty (Id) based on the ratio of the nominal movement distance and the size of the target. Operating with different speed or accuracy biases, performers may utilize more or less area than the target specifies, introducing another subjective layer of speed-accuracy tradeoff relative to the task specification. A conventional approach to overcome the impact of the subjective layer of speed-accuracy tradeoff is to use the a posteriori "effective" pointing precision We in lieu of the nominal target width W. Such an approach has lacked a theoretical or empirical foundation. This study investigates the nature and the relationship of the two layers of speed-accuracy tradeoff by systematically controlling both I d and the index of target utilization Iu in a set of four experiments. Their results show that the impacts of the two layers of speed-accuracy tradeoff are not fundamentally equivalent. The use of W e could indeed compensate for the difference in target utilization, but not completely. More logical Fitts' law parameter estimates can be obtained by the We adjustment, although its use also lowers the correlation between pointing time and the index of difficulty. The study also shows the complex interaction effect between Id and Iu, suggesting that a simple and complete model accommodating both layers of speed-accuracy tradeoff may not exist. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

But the evidence and the arguments that exposed deep conceptual and empirical problems in the picture theory over the past 300 years have not gone away. I argue that the new evidence from neural imaging and clinical neuropsychology does little to justify this recidivism because it does not address the format of mental images.

We found that the pupillary response during a delay was modulated by the number of items to be held in memory, reaching asymptote close to capacity limits. Furthermore, we found that during the delay, how individuals allocated attention to items in WM depended on the number of items to be held, as well as on an individual's capacity. Finally, we found that pretrial pupil diameter distinguished correct and error responses and that individuals with more variability in pretrial pupil diameter had lower behavioral capacity estimates. These results suggest that individual differences in WM are due both to differences in the amount of attention that can be allocated to maintain items in WM and to differences in fluctuations in attention control across trials.},

abstract = {Reanalysis in language comprehension provides a window on how superficially similar processes of conflict resolution may differ depending on the context in which they are initiated. Thus, previous ERP studies have shown that reanalyses towards object-initial orders in German sentences with dative-active verbs (e.g., folgen, 'to follow') engender N400 effects, while reanalyses with accusative verbs (e.g., besuchen, 'to visit') elicit P600 effects. This difference appears surprising since these two verb classes are both associated with a subject-initial base order. The present paper reports two ERP experiments designed to shed further light on the nature of the conflict resolution processes involved in each case by examining structures in which word order disambiguation is separated from verb class disambiguation. Experiment 1 contrasted dative-active verbs with accusative verbs, while Experiment 2 compared dative-active and dative object-experiencer verbs (which are associated with an object-initial base order). Our results show that the reanalysis pattern for dative-active constructions is context-dependent: when verb class disambiguation precedes word order disambiguation, an N400-P600 pattern results. By contrast, the reanalysis patterns for the other two verb types are context independent: object-experiencer verbs invariably show an N400 and accusative verbs invariably show a P600. We argue that (a) the N400 is a general marker of reanalysis in dative sentences, reflecting an argument reindexation, while (b) the P600 in accusative sentences reflects a structural recomputation. The variable pattern for dative-active sentences reflects the (in)applicability of "good-enough" representations during conflict resolution in garden path sentences.},

abstract = {Monolingual speakers of Japanese were trained to identify English /r/ and /l/ using Logan et al.'s [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 89, 874-886 (1991)] high-variability training procedure. Subjects' performance improved from the pretest to the post-test and during the 3 weeks of training. Performance during training varied as a function of talker and phonetic environment. Generalization accuracy to new words depended on the voice of the talker producing the /r/-/l/ contrast: Subjects were significantly more accurate when new words were produced by a familiar talker than when new words were produced by an unfamiliar talker. This difference could not be attributed to differences in intelligibility of the stimuli. Three and six months after the conclusion of training, subjects returned to the laboratory and were given the post-test and tests of generalization again. Performance was surprisingly good on each test after 3 months without any further training: Accuracy decreased only 2{\%} from the post-test given at the end of training to the post-test given 3 months later. Similarly, no significant decrease in accuracy was observed for the tests of generalization. After 6 months without training, subjects' accuracy was still 4.5{\%} above pretest levels. Performance on the tests of generalization did not decrease and significant differences were still observed between talkers. The present results suggest that the high-variability training paradigm encourages a long-term modification of listeners' phonetic perception. Changes in perception are brought about by shifts in selective attention to the acoustic cues that signal phonetic contrasts. These modifications in attention appear to be retrained over time, despite the fact that listeners are not exposed to the /r/-/l/ contrast in their native language environment.},

abstract = {One of the oldest ideas in experimental psychology is that the time between stimulus and reponse is occupied by a train of processes or stages--some being mental operations--which are so arranged that one process does not begin until the predceding one had ended. This stage theory implies that the reaction time is a sum, composed of the durations of the stages in the series, and suggests that if one could determine the component times that add together to make up the RT, one might then be able to answer interesting questions about mental operations to which they correspond. The study of RT should therefore prove helpful to an understanding of the structure of mental activity. The use of results from RT experiments to study stages of information processing began about a century ago with a paper, ''on the Speed of Mental Proesses'', by F.C. Donders(1868). It was in this paper that Donders introduced the subtraction method--a method for analyzing the RT into its components and thereby studing the corresponding stages of processsing.},

The present article introduces an index of complexity, called the mean minimum distance, defined as the average squared distance between an arbitrary data point and the prediction range of the model. It may also be expressed as a dimensionless quantity called the scaled mean minimum distance. For linear models, theoretical values for the scaled mean minimum distance and the variance of the scaled minimum distance can be readily obtained and compared against empirical estimates obtained from fits to random data. The approach is applied to resolving the question of the relative complexity of the Linear Integration model and the Fuzzy Logic of Perception model, both of which have been the subject of controversy in the field of depth perception. It is concluded that the two models are equally complex.},

abstract = {Visual search is central to the investigation of selective visual attention. Classical theories propose that items are identified by serially deploying focal attention to their locations. While this accounts for set-size effects over a continuum of task difficulties, it has been suggested that parallel models can account for such effects equally well. We compared the serial Competitive Guided Search model with a parallel model in their ability to account for RT distributions and error rates from a large visual search data-set featuring three classical search tasks: 1) a spatial configuration search (2 vs. 5); 2) a feature-conjunction search; and 3) a unique feature search (Wolfe, Palmer {\&} Horowitz Vision Research, 50(14), 1304-1311, 2010). In the parallel model, each item is represented by a diffusion to two boundaries (target-present/absent); the search corresponds to a parallel race between these diffusors. The parallel model was highly flexible in that it allowed both for a parametric range of capacity-limitation and for set-size adjustments of identification boundaries. Furthermore, a quit unit allowed for a continuum of search-quitting policies when the target is not found, with "single-item inspection" and exhaustive searches comprising its extremes. The serial model was found to be superior to the parallel model, even before penalizing the parallel model for its increased complexity. We discuss the implications of the results and the need for future studies to resolve the debate.},

In sentence production, mismatches in the grammatical number of the head and local noun phrases lead to agreement errors on the verb as in: the key to the cabinets are. Similarly, although ungrammaticality typically causes disruption in measures of sentence comprehension, the disruption is reduced when the local noun phrase has a plural feature. Using a forced-choice comprehension question method, we report two experiments that provide evidence that comprehenders were likely to misinterpret the number information on the head noun phrase when morphosyntactic number markings on the local noun phrase and verb did not match the head. These results are consistent with a growing body of research that suggests that comprehenders often arrive at a final interpretation of a sentence that is not faithful to the linguistic input.},

abstract = {A novel method of chronic optical imaging based on new voltage-sensitive
dyes (VSDs) was developed to facilitate the explorations of the spatial
and temporal patterns underlying higher cognitive functions in the
neocortex of behaving monkeys. Using this system, we were able to
explore cortical dynamics, with high spatial and temporal resolution,
over period of {\textless}or=1 yr from the same patch of cortex. The visual
cortices of trained macaques were stained one to three times a week,
and immediately after each staining session, the monkey started to
perform the behavioral task, while the primary and secondary visual
areas (V1 and V2) were imaged with a fast optical imaging system.
Long-term repeated VSD imaging (VSDI) from the same cortical area
did not disrupt the normal cortical architecture as confirmed repeatedly
by optical imaging based on intrinsic signals. The spatial patterns
of functional maps obtained by VSDI were essentially identical to
those obtained from the same patch of cortex by imaging based on
intrinsic signals. On comparing the relative amplitudes of the evoked
signals and differential map obtained using these two different imaging
methodologies, we found that VSDI emphasizes subthreshold activity
more than imaging based on intrinsic signals, that emphasized more
spiking activity. The latency of the VSD-evoked response in V1 ranged
from 46 to 68 ms in the different monkeys. The amplitude of the V2
response was only 20-60{\%} of that in V1. As expected from the anatomy,
the retinotopic responses to local visual stimuli spread laterally
across the cortical surface at a spreading velocity of 0.15-0.19
m/s over a larger area than that expected by the classical magnification
factor, reaching its maximal anisotropic spatial extent within approximately
40 ms. We correlated the observed dynamics of cortical activation
patterns with the monkey's saccadic eye movements and found that
due to the slow offset of the cortical response relative to its onset,
there was a short period of simultaneous activation of two distinct
patches of cortex following a saccade to the visual stimulus. We
also found that a saccade to a small stimulus was followed by direct
transient activation of a cortical region in areas of V1 and V2,
located retinotopically within the saccadic trajectory.},

Two associations consistently emerge in mean latency data. Firstly, across subjects, mean latencies on distinct tasks are positively correlated. This correlation arises from individual differences in general rates of information processing that are a shared influence on response latency in diverse tasks. Secondly, across tasks, the mean and variance of mean latency are positively correlated. Compared to a simple task, a complex task has both a larger average mean latency and a larger variance of mean latency, across subjects. Taken together, these associations make the interpretation of the MLD problematic by biasing correlations between the MLD and (a) task mean latencies, (b) the average of the mean latencies, (c) external criteria, and (d) other MLDs. A variety of mean latency transformations were evaluated and, while they differed in their effectiveness, they did not satisfactorily rectify MLD biases. An alternative approach, focusing on scale invariant contrasts of within-subject response latency distributions, is introduced in the conclusion.},

abstract = {Bayes factors have been advocated as superior to p-values for assessing statistical evidence in data. Despite the advantages of Bayes factors and the drawbacks of p-values, inference by p-values is still nearly ubiquitous. One impediment to the adoption of Bayes factors is a lack of practical development, particularly a lack of ready-to-use formulas and algorithms. In this paper, we discuss and expand a set of default Bayes factor tests for ANOVA designs. These tests are based on multivariate generalizations of Cauchy priors on standardized effects, and have the desirable properties of being invariant with respect to linear transformations of measurement units. Moreover, these Bayes factors are computationally convenient, and straightforward sampling algorithms are provided. We cover models with fixed, random, and mixed effects, including random interactions, and do so for within-subject, between-subject, and mixed designs. We extend the discussion to regression models with continuous covariates. We also discuss how these Bayes factors may be applied in nonlinear settings, and show how they are useful in differentiating between the power law and the exponential law of skill acquisition. In sum, the current development makes the computation of Bayes factors straightforward for the vast majority of designs in experimental psychology. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

A self-paced reading task was used to present short texts comprising one, two, or three sentences. The {\textregistered} rst sentence of each text introduced a stereotypically masculine or feminine participant (e.g. doctor, nurse), or a neutral one. The last sentence introduced a pronoun (he/she) that could match or mismatch the gender of the referent. The {\textregistered} rst experiment, which was carried out in English, showed that reading times for the last sentence were longer when there was a mismatch than when there was a match between the gender of the pronoun in the last sentence and the stereotypical gender of the referent in the {\textregistered} rst sentence. In contrast to English, the gender of the participant can be disambiguated by a preceding article (el/la ) in Spanish. The results of the second, third, and fourth experiments, which were carried out in Spanish, showed that reading times for the {\textregistered} rst sentences were longer when there was a mismatch than when there was a match between the gender of the article and the stereotypical gender of the participant. However, reading times for the last sentences did not differ. Overall, the results suggest that information about the stereotypical gender of the participants in a text is incorporated into the representation as soon as it becomes available, and that it affects the ease with which the text is understood.},

The mathematical function that best describes this decrease has been the subject of intense debate. Here, we seek a deeper understanding of the practice effect by simultaneously taking into account the changes in accuracy and in RT distributions with practice, both for correct and error responses. To this end, we used the Ratcliff diffusion model, a successful model of two-choice RTs that decomposes the effect of practice into its constituent psychological processes. Analyses of data from a 10,000-trial lexical decision task demonstrate that practice not only affects the speed of information processing, but also response caution, response bias, and peripheral processing time. We conclude that the practice effect consists of multiple subcomponents, and that it may be hazardous to abstract the interactive combination of these subcomponents in terms of a single output measure such as mean RT for correct responses.

abstract = {The research reported here is a systematic investigation of what competent, native speakers of English, native to contemporary syntactic theory, judge to be grammatically acceptable patterns of co-reference involving names and pronouns. Its central goal is the specification of syntactic factors that influence co-reference within and between sentences. The results show that naive subjects have consistent intuitions of grammaticality that agree with some principles of contemporary binding theory. The results also show that naive subjects diverge substantially from syntactic theorists in other judgments of grammaticality. In particular, subjects have strong intuitions that reflexives and pronouns are in complementary distribution, a fact that supports contemporary syntactic theory. Beyond that domain, subjects' judgments of co-reference in name-pronoun, name-name, and pronoun-name sequences are systematically influenced by syntactic structure in ways that are not consistent with syntactic theory. Co-reference in name-pronoun sequences is generally quite acceptable but becomes more acceptable as the syntactic prominence of the name increases. Co-reference in name-name sequences is only moderately acceptable and becomes less acceptable as the syntactic prominence of the first name increases. Co-reference in pronoun-name sequences is generally unacceptable and is only weakly influenced by the kinds of syntactic prominence that affect other relations of co-reference. We account for these results through the elaboration of a model of the process by which syntactic representations are mapped onto a representation of discourse capable of expressing generalizations about co-reference both intra-sententially and inter-sententially.},

abstract = {When participants are asked to respond in the same way to stimuli from different sources (e.g., auditory and visual), responses are often observed to be substantially faster when both stimuli are presented simultaneously (redundancy gain). Different models account for this effect, the two most important being race models and coactivation models. Redundancy gains consistent with the race model have an upper limit, however, which is given by the well-known race model inequality (Miller, 1982). A number of statistical tests have been proposed for testing the race model inequality in single participants and groups of participants. All of these tests use the race model as the null hypothesis, and rejection of the null hypothesis is considered evidence in favor of coactivation. We introduce a statistical test in which the race model prediction is the alternative hypothesis. This test controls the Type I error if a theory predicts that the race model prediction holds in a given experimental condition.},

Here we exploited a phonological regularity of English indefinite articles ('an' precedes nouns beginning with vowel sounds, whereas 'a' precedes nouns beginning with consonant sounds) in combination with event-related brain potential recordings from the human scalp to show that readers' brains can pre-activate individual words in a graded fashion to a degree that can be estimated from the probability that each word is given as a continuation for a sentence fragment offline. These findings are evidence that readers use the words in a sentence (as cues to their world knowledge) to estimate relative likelihoods for upcoming words.},

abstract = {We used Chinese prenominal relative clauses (RCs) to test the predictions of two competing accounts of sentence comprehension difficulty: the experience-based account of Levy (2008) and the Dependency Locality Theory (DLT; Gibson, 2000). Given that in Chinese RCs, a classifier and/or a passive marker BEI can be added to the sentence-initial position, we manipulated the presence/absence of classifiers and the presence/absence of BEI, such that BEI sentences were passivized subject-extracted RCs, and no-BEI sentences were standard object-extracted RCs. We conducted two self-paced reading experiments, using the same critical stimuli but somewhat dif-ferent filler items. Reading time patterns from both experiments showed facilitative effects of BEI within and beyond RC regions, and delayed facilitative effects of classifiers, suggesting that cues that occur before a clear signal of an upcoming RC can help Chinese comprehenders to anticipate RC structures. The data patterns are not predicted by the DLT, but they are consistent with the predictions of experience-based theories.},

False ''change " judgments increased dramatically with increasing lag, consistent with the idea that study items with long lags were ejected from a discrete-slots buf-fer. Error RTs were nearly invariant with set size and lag, consistent with the idea that the errors were produced by a stimulus-independent guessing process. The patterns of error and RT data could not be explained in terms of encoding limitations, but were consistent with the hypothesis that long retention lags produced a zero-stimulus-information state that required guessing. Formal modeling of the change-detection RT and error data pointed toward a hybrid model of visual working memory. The hybrid model assumed mixed states involving a combination of memory and guessing, but with higher memory resolution for items with shorter retention lags. The work raises new questions concerning the nature of the memory representations that are produced across the closely related tasks of change detection and visual memory search.},

abstract = {It is well known that real-time human language processing is highly incremental and context-driven, and that the strength of a comprehender's expectation for each word encountered is a key determinant of the difficulty of integrating that word into the preceding context. In reading, this differential difficulty is largely manifested in the amount of time taken to read each word. While numerous studies over the past thirty years have shown expectation-based effects on reading times driven by lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and other information sources, there has been little progress in establishing the quantitative relationship between expectation (or prediction) and reading times. Here, by combining a state-of-the-art computational language model, two large behavioral data-sets, and non-parametric statistical techniques, we establish for the first time the quantitative form of this relationship, finding that it is logarithmic over six orders of magnitude in estimated predictability. This result is problematic for a number of established models of eye movement control in reading, but lends partial support to an optimal perceptual discrimination account of word recognition. We also present a novel model in which language processing is highly incremental well below the level of the individual word, and show that it predicts both the shape and time-course of this effect. At a more general level, this result provides challenges for both anticipatory processing and semantic integration accounts of lexical predictability effects. And finally, this result provides evidence that comprehenders are highly sensitive to relative differences in predictability - even for differences between highly unpredictable words - and thus helps bring theoretical unity to our understanding of the role of prediction at multiple levels of linguistic structure in real-time language comprehension. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An eye-movement monitoring experiment investigated readers' response to temporarily ambiguous sentences. The sentences were ambiguous because a relative clause could attach to one of two preceding nouns. Semantic information disambiguated the sentences. Working memory considerations predict an overall preference for the second of the two nouns, as does the late closure principle (Frazier, On comprehending sentences: Syntactic parsing strategies. Ph.D. dissertation, University of Connecticut. West Bend, IN: Indiana University Linguistics Club, 1979). Previous studies assessing preferences for such items have obtained mixed results. On-line assessments show that working memory affects the degree of preference for the first noun, with lower capacity readers having a greater preference for the second noun (Felser et al., Language Acquisition: A Journal of Developmental Linguistics, 11, 127-163, 2003; Traxler, Memory {\&} Cognition, 35, 1107-1121, 2007). Off-line assessments indicate the opposite pattern of preferences when the test sentences are displayed on a single line (Swets et al., Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 136, 64-81, 2007). However, when implicit prosody is manipulated by displaying the sentences with a break between the second noun and the relative clause, the off-line assessments indicate that readers prefer to attach the relative clause to the first noun. In this experiment, readers' undertook a working memory assessment and then read test sentences that were displayed across two lines, with a break appearing after the second noun and before the relative clause. The eye-tracking data indicated an overall preference to attach the relative clause to the first noun, and there was little indication that working memory moderated the degree of preference for this configuration. Hence, it appears that readers' implicit prosodic contours rapidly affect resolution of adjunct attachment ambiguities.},

abstract = {Researchers have extensively documented how various statistical properties of words (e.g., word frequency) influence lexical processing. However, the impact of lexical variables on nonword decision- making performance is less clear. This gap is surprising, because a better specification of the mechanisms driving nonword responses may provide valuable insights into early lexical processes. In the present study, item-level and participant-level analyses were conducted on the trial-level lexical decision data for almost 37,000 nonwords in the English Lexicon Project in order to identify the influence of different psycholinguistic variables on nonword lexical decision performance and to explore individual differences in how participants respond to nonwords. Item-level regression analyses reveal that nonword response time was positively correlated with number of letters, number of orthographic neighbors, number of affixes, and base-word number of syllables, and negatively correlated with Levenshtein orthographic distance and base-word frequency. Participant-level analyses also point to within- and between-session stability in nonword responses across distinct sets of items, and intriguingly reveal that higher vocabulary knowledge is associated with less sensitivity to some dimensions (e.g., number of letters) but more sensitivity to others (e.g., base-word frequency). The present findings provide well-specified and interesting new constraints for informing models of word recognition and lexical decision.},

Addressing the prior plausibility of the model assumption is unavoidable if the goal is to determine how plausible it is that the model assumption holds. Without assessing the prior plausibility of the model assumptions, it remains fully uncertain whether the model of interest gives an adequate description of the data and thus whether it can be considered valid for the application at hand. Although addressing the prior plausibility is difficult, ignoring the prior plausibility is not an option if we want to claim that the inferences of our statistical model can be relied upon.},

The probe item evokes the search set on the basis of probe–memory item relatedness, just as a ringing tuning fork evokes sympathetic vibrations in other tuning forks. Evidence is accumulated in parallel from each probe–memory item comparison, and each comparison is modeled by a continuous random walk process. In item recognition, the decision process is self-terminating on matching comparisons and exhaustive on nonmatching comparisons. The mathematical model produces predictions about accuracy, mean reaction time, error latency, and reaction time distributions that are in good accord with data from 2 experiments conducted with 6 undergraduates. The theory is applied to 4 item recognition paradigms (Sternberg, prememorized list, study–test, and continuous) and to speed–accuracy paradigms; results are found to provide a basis for comparison of these paradigms. It is noted that neural network models can be interfaced to the retrieval theory with little difficulty and that semantic memory models may benefit from such a retrieval scheme.

abstract = {Interpreting a verb-phrase ellipsis (VP ellipsis) requires accessing an antecedent in memory, and then integrating a representation of this antecedent into the local context. We investigated the online interpretation of VP ellipsis in an eye-tracking experiment and four speed–accuracy tradeoff experiments. To investigate whether the antecedent for a VP ellipsis is accessed with a search or direct-access retrieval process, Experiments 1 and 2 measured the effect of the distance between an ellipsis and its antecedent on the speed and accuracy of comprehension. Accuracy was lower with longer distances, indicating that interpolated material reduced the quality of retrieved information about the ante-cedent. However, contra a search process, distance did not affect the speed of interpreting ellipsis. This pattern suggests that antecedent representations are content-addressable and retrieved with a direct-access process. To determine whether interpreting ellipsis involves copying antecedent information into the ellipsis site, Experiments 3–5 manipulated the length and complexity of the antecedent. Some types of antecedent complexity lowered accuracy, notably, the num-ber of discourse entities in the antecedent. However, neither antecedent length nor complexity affected the speed of interpreting the ellipsis. This pattern is inconsistent with a copy operation, and it suggests that ellipsis interpretation may involve a pointer to extant structures in memory.},

abstract = {This paper presents a corpus study of the order between subject and object in German main and embedded clauses. Since prior studies have shown that object-subject (OS) sentences are rare in comparison to subject-object (SO) sentences, for both main and embedded clauses two corpora were assembled: One corpus containing both SO and OS sentences, and a second corpus containing only OS sentences. In accordance with prior work, the rate of OS sentences was low, but the construction of a corpus restricted to OS sentences still allowed a statistical analysis of OS sentences. For embedded clauses, the main results of the current corpus study are: (i) accusative objects predominate in SO sentences but dative objects in OS sentences. (ii) The use of OS order is tied to lexical-semantic properties of verbs and their arguments. OS order occurs mainly when the subject is inanimate and the object animate. The verbs used in OS sentences are mainly ditransitive verbs in the passive voice and unaccusative verbs. (iii) Weight had no significant effect on order. For main clauses with either subject or object in the prefield somewhat different results were found. Following the presentation of the corpus results, we discuss how they fit into current conceptions of word-order variation. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@misc{Preacher2012,
abstract = {In many circumstances, a given linear or nonlinear model may be sensible from a theoretical perspective and may fit the data well, yet may have parameters that are difficult to interpret in a meaningful way. Such models often may be reparameterized. Reparameterization is the reexpression of a target model so that parameters of the reexpressed model more closely align with questions of substantive interest to the researcher. In this chapter the authors discuss various ways in which reparameterization may be used in the context of latent growth curve modeling (LGM), a powerful and flexible application of structural equation modeling (SEM) often used to model trends in longitudinal data and individual differences in those trends. As is seen in this chapter, reparameterization can be extremely useful to researchers. To provide a framework for our discussion, the authors describe three illustrative (but by no means exhaustive) classes of reparameterization, and present exemplar from each class: (1) quantifying homogeneity or heterogeneity of individuals, (2) estimating and predicting aspects of change, and (3) estimating and predicting time-specific individual differences. To illustrate the quantification of homogeneity or heterogeneity, the authors use the context of adolescents' delinquent peer associations to discuss how a linear growth curve model may be reparameterized so that the aperture (the point in time associated with the least variable individual differences) is directly estimated as a model parameter. As an example of estimation and prediction of aspects of change, the authors demonstrate the estimation of individually varying surge points and surge slopes (Choi, Harring, {\&} Hancock, 2009) in elementary school children's mathematics scores, and show how gender can be used as a person-level predictor of these random effects. To illustrate the estimation and prediction of time-specific individual differences, we show how to reparameterize a nonlinear function of infant growth so that individual differences can be operationalized as a random effect and predicted by maternal breast-feeding behavior. Clearly, individual differences are central to each of these exemplars, as they often are in models of change over time. In each case, the target of reparameterization will become an estimated parameter or a random effect reflecting individual differences in the target aspect. This chapter thus serves as an introduction to the general concept of reparameterization. It is the authors' intention and hope that readers will gain an understanding of reparameterizadon that will allow them to generalize the procedure to new contexts. In this chapter, the authors discuss the concept of reparameterization as a general tool that can be used in the context of modeling longitudinal data. Then, they elaborate on the empirical examples as exemplars reflecting the three broad classes of reparameterization. At the end of the chapter, the authors suggest other potential reparameterization classes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {The present study examined how proofreading and reading-for-comprehension instructions influence eye movements during reading. Thirty-seven participants silently read sentences containing compound words as target words while their eye movements were being recorded. We manipulated word length and frequency to examine how task instructions influence orthographic versus lexical-semantic processing during reading. Task instructions influenced both temporal and spatial aspects of eye movements: The initial landing position in words was shifted leftward, the saccade length was shorter, first fixation and gaze duration were longer, and refixation probability was higher during proofreading than during reading for comprehension. Moreover, in comparison to instructions for reading for comprehension, proofreading instructions increased both orthographic and lexical-semantic processing. This became apparent in a greater word length and word frequency effect in gaze duration during proofreading than during reading for comprehension. The present study suggests that the allocation of attentional resources during reading is significantly modulated by task demands.},

abstract = {Two eye movement experiments examined effects on syntactic reanalysis when the correct analysis was briefly entertained at an earlier point in the sentence. In Experiment 1, participants read sentences containing a noun phrase coordination/clausal coordination ambiguity, while in Experiment 2 they read sentences containing a subordinate clause object/main clause subject ambiguity. The critical conditions were designed to induce readers to construct the ultimately correct analysis just prior to being garden-pathed by the incorrect analysis. In both experiments, the earliest measures of the garden path effect were not modulated by this manipulation. However, there was significantly less regressive re-reading of the sentence in those conditions in which the correct analysis was likely to have been constructed, then abandoned, at an earlier point. These results suggest that a syntactic analysis that is abandoned in the course of processing a sentence is not lost altogether, and can be re-activated or retrieved from memory. Implications for models of initial syntactic analysis and reanalysis are discussed.},

abstract = {Investigated the size of the visual region within which adults use visual information to distinguish among letters as they read. 15 undergraduates were asked to read passages from a CRT as their eye movements were monitored. On occasional fixations during reading, letters in specified regions were replaced by other letters, thus providing erroneous text in specific retinal regions. The effects of this manipulation were observed on Ss' eye movement patterns. Data show that erroneous letters lying 4 or more letter positions to the left of the fixated letter, or 8 or more to the right, had no discernible effect on reading. There was no evidence to indicate that prior research in which letters were replaced on every fixation had underestimated the size of the perceptual span. The fact that the present study yielded a smaller estimate of the perceptual span and showed smaller effects from letter replacement than have previous studies is explained by methodological differences in the aspect of the text stimulus being studied.

abstract = {What theories best characterise the parsing processes triggered upon encountering ambiguity, and what effects do these processes have on eye movement patterns in reading? The present eye-tracking study, which investigated processing of attachment ambiguities of an adjunct in Spanish, suggests that readers sometimes underspecify attachment to save memory resources, consistent with the good-enough account of parsing. Our results confirm a surprising prediction of the good-enough account: high-capacity readers commit to an attachment decision more often than low-capacity participants, leading to more errors and a greater need to reanalyse in garden-path sentences. These results emerged only when we separated functionally different types of regressive eye movements using a scanpath analysis; conventional eye-tracking measures alone would have led to different conclusions. The scanpath analysis also showed that rereading was the dominant strategy for recovering from garden-pathing. Our results may also have broader implications for models of reading processes: reanalysis effects in eye movements occurred late, which suggests that the coupling of oculo-motor control and the parser may not be as tight as assumed in current computational models of eye movement control in reading.
