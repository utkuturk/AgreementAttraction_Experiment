## Turkish relative clauses and plural marking

Before discussing the experiments, I will touch upon the mechanisms that I utilize in the experiments: optional plural agreement, relative clause structure, and syncretism between possessive and accusative. 

Turkish plural agreement is quite similar with regards to the subject-verb number agreement in the first and second plural person. However, Turkish plural agreement is optional in third person plurals as shown in \autoref{TB1} and \autoref{TB2}. The other important characteristicc of Turkish plural agreement is the fact that the nominal and verbal plural marking is done by the same morpheme *-lAr*\footnote{The convention of using an uppercase A is to show that the morpheme can surface as either \textit{-ler} or \textit{-lar} according to the previous vowel due to the vowel harmony reasons.}. 


\begin{exe}
\ex \label{TB1} Dün çocuk-\textsc{Lar} okul-a git-ti-\textsc{Ler} mi?
\ex 
\gll Dün çocuk-LAR okul-a git-ti mi?\\
yesterday child-\textsc{Pl} school-\textsc{Dat} go-\textsc{Pst}(-\textsc{Pl}) Q\\
\trans ``Did the children go to school yesterday?''
\label{TB2}
\end{exe}

As for Turkish relative clauses, they always precede the external head noun [@Goksel2004; @Taylan2015] and they use either *-An* or *-dIk* nomilizers to show the referentiality of the subject within the relative clause as shown in \autoref{TB3} and \autoref{TB4} [@Haig1997]. Moreover, due to pro-drop and null object properties of the Turkish [see @Ozturk2005], relative clauses can consist of only the verb itself in Turkish as in \autoref{TB5}.

\begin{exe}
\ex \label{TB3}
\gll Kazı-lar-ın yap-ıl-dığ-ı alan ... \\
excavation-\textsc{Pl}-\textsc{Gen} do-\textsc{Pass}-\textsc{Nmlz}-\textsc{Poss} area ... \\
\glt ``The place where the excavations are done ...''
\ex \label{TB4}
\gll Kazı-lar yap-ıl-an alan ... \\
excavation-\textsc{Pl} do-\textsc{Pass}-\textsc{Nmlz} area ... \\
\glt ``A place where some excavations are done ...''
\ex \label{TB5}
\gll Gör-düğ-ü kuş çok güzel-di.\\
see-\textsc{Nmlz}-\textsc{Poss} bird very pretty-\textsc{Pst}\\
\glt ``The bird that he/she saw was very pretty.''
\end{exe}

Final characteristics that interest us in this paper is the morphological syncretism between the accusative case and possessive suffix in Turkish. When the possessive case is attached to a nominal stem that ends with a consonant, it is pronounced as \textit{-I}, which is exactly how the accusative case is also pronounced in the same environment in Turkish. However, the ambiguity is immediately resolved when they follow a nominal stem that ends with a vowel. In the latter environment, the accusative case surfaces as *-yI* whereas the possessive surfaces as *-sI(n)*\footnote{The final \textit{n} only surfaces when any other morphemes follow the possessive suffix. Otherwise, it surfaces as \textit{-sI}} as shown in \autoref{TB6}-\autoref{TB9}.

\begin{exe}
\ex
\begin{xlist}
\ex \label{TB6}
\gll Kuş-\textbf{u} beğen-di-m.\\
bird-\textsc{Acc} like-\textsc{Pst}-\textsc{1Sg}\\
\glt ``I liked the bird.''
\ex \label{TB7}
\gll Emin'in kuş-\textbf{u} güzel-miş.\\
Emin-\textsc{Gen} bird-\textsc{Poss} pretty-\textsc{Evd}\\
\glt ``Emin's bird was pretty.''
\ex \label{TB8}
\gll Kedi-\textbf{yi} beğen-di-m.\\
cat-\textsc{Acc} like-\textsc{Pst}-\textsc{1Sg}\\
\glt ``I liked the cat.''
\ex \label{TB9}
\gll Emin'in kedi-\textbf{si} güzel-miş.\\
Emin-\textsc{Gen} cat-\textsc{Poss} pretty-\textsc{Evd}\\
\glt ``Emin's cat was pretty.''
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}
